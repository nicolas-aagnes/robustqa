Gray wolves are their ancestors. Scholars are pretty consistent on this. And researchers have suggested that the origin of dogs could go back to Europe, the Middle East, Siberia, and southern China.

Boyko of Cornell University, as well as an international team of other scientists, have studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or country dogs. Dr. Shannon analyzed three different types of DNA, said Dr. Boyko, the first time this had been done on such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the origin of dogs in much the same way that genetic research has determined the origin of modern humans in East Africa. The analysis, according to Dr. Boyko, points to Central Asia as the place where \"all dogs living today\" come from. According to him, the data does not allow to accurately date the origin, but shows that it happened at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson from the University of Oxford, who is leading a major international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \"It's really cool to see not only the number of street dogs, but also the geographic latitude and the number of remote locations where dog samples have been taken,\" he said in an email.

In Washington, a federal judge last week barred the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. A judge has temporarily suspended a new federal rule that requires major new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And now there are plain text warnings. Congress called for the creation of color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to the one Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements, approved in June, violate their constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights. Judge Leon said the FDA cannot require new labels until a decision is made on the lawsuit against the government. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he thought the cigarette manufacturers were more likely to win the case. He said the images should appeal to emotion, rejecting the government's arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use labels to promote an \"obvious anti-smoking agenda\". The head of the anti-smoking group Campaign for Tobacco Free Children called the decision \"scientifically wrong and wrong legally.\" About one fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization claims that tobacco kills almost six million people worldwide every year. Of these, more than six hundred thousand non-smokers who inhale someone else's tobacco smoke.

The interior of the Earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well is only six miles into the earth's crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but reached the bottom about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole Project, a US plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles deep to the boundary between the hard rocks of the earth's crust and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the project received state support. It's getting harder and harder to drill deep into the ground because the rocks are getting softer and softer. Rocks that are hard but break easily at the surface become ductile at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlying crust\u2014about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles\u2014makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the interior of the Earth (such as the fact that there is a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from circumstantial evidence such as analysis of earthquakes. So perhaps it's time for a thorough new method of exploring the land within. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we must open the crack. Stevenson proposes to dig a crack about half a mile long, a yard wide, and half a mile deep (not with a shovel), but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Then, together with the robot, he poured several hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move down at about 16 feet per second, pulling the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The mass of iron will descend about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the Earth's core, and the robot will send data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \u201cWe're going to places we haven't been before,\u201d he says. \"In all likelihood, there will be surprises.\" This idea could probably be put in a box marked \"Won't Happen\".

So, next academic year, semester 1 will be as always: sentences to paragraphing . And term 2 will work on a 5 paragraph essay. The last 3 weeks of Semester 2 will be reserved for TOEFL and CEE preparation. By this time, if the students have completed their work correctly, they should be able to write fairly well. As far as the Latin course is concerned, next week I'll be putting up posters around campus so students know what's on offer before I actually introduce the course. Several students have already emailed me about the course. I'm sure you don't understand how important it is that we open this program in our school. People all over the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many awards available to students who excel in the course. Please share my words with the administration.

This is clearly a thing, and yet it allows you to experience eating out. I love eating outside so my garden table is one of my favorite purchases. Therefore, I believe that the boundary between things and experiences is more subtle than at first glance. However, the most important thing for happiness is what purchases you made. Sometimes we can all have purchases that feel like a waste of money, like having half of our clothes in our closets, but how does that happen? There are many reasons why this is happening. The biggest one is that we spend a lot of time at work to earn money to buy things. The problem is that we buy a lot of things that we don't really need.

The problem is so serious that urgent action is needed, warns a study by British and Chinese scientists. The investigation surveyed 2,191 students aged 9 to 12 in nine schools in urban and rural Zhejiang, a very prosperous coastal province in east China. 81% of boys said they were \u201cvery\u201d worried about exams, 63% feared being punished by a teacher, 44% had been physically bullied at least occasionally \u2013 with boys being more likely to be victims than girls \u2013 and 73% were physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained that they had difficulty coping with the amount of homework they were given. More than a third reported headaches or abdominal pain - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported pain frequency four times a week. An investigation led by Teresa Hesketh, a professor at the Center for International Health and Development at University College London (UCL), pointed the finger at China's extreme competitiveness in education since the beginning of elementary school. \"Competitive and punitive educational environments lead to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" the authors say. \u201cThere is an urgent need to take action to reduce the unnecessary burden on children in schools.\u201d The article was published in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" site for the study was Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, and the \"rural\" site was a poor county in Quzhou Prefecture in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that he says explain demands for academic excellence and an intolerance for failure. One factor is the country's booming wealth, which has created \"unprecedented career opportunities\" and, in turn, increased pressure on children to do well in school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience and discipline. \u201cThe aspirations of many parents who themselves had limited educational opportunities are now invested in their only children,\u201d it says. Previous research on school-related stress and its impact on health is scarce and has mostly been done in Scandinavia.

Instead, the state lives off oil and gas.\u201d In economic terms, the numbers are on the side of Aslund. The International Monetary Fund estimates that in 2009 the Russian economy will contract by 6.7 percent, while China's economy will grow by 8.5 percent and India by 5.4 percent. Brazil fared less, with a 0.7 percent drop, but it still fared much better than Russia. But BRIC is not only about the economy.

And advertising can bring relief to parents tired of donating money to support schools. While parents can always turn off televisions or computers, they cannot ban advertising in schools. This is not the first time the issue has arisen. For example, a teen news program has been criticized for including commercials in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts. And parent groups successfully opposed Bus Radio's plan to put music and advertisements on school buses. But now everything is different. Just last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow companies to advertise in the district's schools. Officials say the plan could provide schools with up to $18 million. In St. Francis, Minnesota, schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their lockers with ads. Time speaks.

Airlines have stopped or changed flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck at airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What distinguishes Grimsvotn is that it lies under a huge glacier up to 12 meters thick. A hot volcano heats the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between the glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. When water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure rises. Then the lava from the volcano comes to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights to avoid flying through clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's largest airlines, planes cannot fly above or below the clouds. Passing through the cloud can cause the ash to become lodged in the aircraft's engines, causing damage to the aircraft. The eruption also caused problems for animals in Iceland.

How do these crowding problems occur and can they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find answers through a more familiar system in which traffic jams occur - traffic flow. Martin Treiber at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany has previously developed traffic flow models. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of the University of Manchester. They viewed traffic as a fluid flowing through a pipe and watched how the flow changed as the fluid became denser. At first, the flow rate increases as density increases, since you are simply passing more material over the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of blockages and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's marathon model uses the same principle: the flow speed first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases due to a sudden switch from free flow to crowded flow. He suggests that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners that everyone maintains throughout the race. With these factors alone, Treiber can calculate the speed of the flow of runners, knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how the lock might depend on race conditions, such as different start routines. Some marathons start with all runners starting at the same time (meaning those in the back have to wait for those in front to advance). Others divide runners into different groups based on ability and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber applied this model to the annual Rennsteig half marathon in central Germany, which draws about 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013 because the police no longer wanted to close the road so that runners could safely cross the road. He could pass either over a 60-meter wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blockage caused by different options. The model predicted that the mass start could overwhelm runners if a bridge was used. Only by moving the starting point further away from the bridge could the danger be avoided, and even so, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only marginally inaccurate, there was still a risk of congestion on the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for a tunnel route. The organizers of the race consulted with Treiber's team and eventually chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2958, "text": "dangerous blocking"}], "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e72ru"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Forbes China's annual celebrity list is based on earnings and appearances in magazines, newspapers, TV shows, and the Internet.

Sounds incredible, doesn't it? Not if the architect is 31-year-old Brian Berg. He made a career building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles and the world's tallest card tower. How he does it? Brian's designs are amazing because they are made entirely from perfectly balanced, free-standing playing cards. He never uses glue, tape or anything else to hold the cards together. He also doesn't fold. He discovered another way to build a sturdy house of cards using nature's trick. To make plants strong, nature builds them into cells with strong walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps the leaves and stems keep their shape. Bees use the same repeating pattern to create strong combs in which they live and store honey. Brian creates similar grids using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He starts with a single cell, created by balancing four cards against each other to form a box. It then repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form a grid that creates a good base for a solid card structure. The larger the mesh, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Brian uses multiple cards instead of just one to build cell walls, which makes the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells the kids as he speaks in class, is to put your cards as close together as possible when laying out the grid, making sure the cards don't tilt at all. With this solid foundation built, Brian lays out the cards on top to make the floor for the building's next \"story\". He may add towers, columns, spiers or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Brian builds structures of amazing strength. In the cards No wonder Brian has always been interested in construction. Raised on a \"big old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \u201cWe were in the middle of nowhere,\u201d recalls Brian, \u201cand we had a lot of space to do whatever we wanted. I've always made things using things like sticks or bales of hay.\" Brian's grandfather taught him how to fold cards. Brian's two passions, building and collecting cards, soon merged. But packing at his family's farmhouse wasn't easy. \u201cOur old house had wooden floors that were not even,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they weren't very durable. When people walked, it was like an \"earthquake\". It was not easy to build something that would not collapse immediately.\u201d Brian built tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built something above himself. When he laid several decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how powerful it was. Brian's towers began to grow higher. How high is too high? Brian first got into the Guinness Book of Records. tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992 when he was in high school. Upon learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Brian built a thin tower 14 feet 6 inches high. The project for the geometry class took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then, he has set world records for even taller buildings. Its last winner was 25 feet 3.5 inches tall and used about 2,400 decks of cards. _ Why don't these towers fall? The key is in a good solid base, a repeating story pattern and a tapering top. Brian likes to point out how similar the card buildings are to the real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. Separate parts form one strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can't be all on top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Brian admits it hurts sometimes to see his buildings crumble.

Depression is a state of mind that most of us experience at some point in time. There are times in our lives when everything seems difficult. Things seem to get worse and we can't control our lives. Research has shown that music can be an important means of lifting the mood in these situations. Music also plays a big role in making us less nervous and anxious. Anxiety can often cause insomnia and other illnesses. Music is often known as an international language. We may not know the language the other person speaks, but most of us react the same way to music. Music can often be the best way to connect with someone. Music is one of the best ways to improve your mood, but it depends a lot on what kind of music you listen to. While upbeat music can certainly make you feel better, sad music can make your mood even worse.

The discovery should address fears that such laws could have the opposite effect, as they could force people to smoke more at home. Several countries such as Japan and Australia have tightened laws on smoking in public places over the past few years. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Complete bans are in place in only half of the US states, and there are few restrictions in poorer countries. Opponents often argue that bans could lead people to smoke more at home, which would be worse for their children's health. Asthma is a major concern as secondhand smoke harms children's airways in several ways. The researchers, led by Jasper Bean of the Maastricht University Medical Center, analyzed 11 studies that looked at how rates of hospitalizations for childhood asthma and preterm birth changed after the introduction of the smoking ban. . The result shows that both asthma hospitalizations and preterm births fell by about 10 percent within a year of smoking restrictions. The impact on preterm labor could also be due to the fact that pregnant women were more likely to quit or cut back on smoking after the public ban, Bean says. But Bean also says that studies cannot fully prove that the smoking ban directly caused these changes. However, in fact, because several smoking bans were included in the analysis, introduced in different countries in different years, and most saw an improvement in health. Such findings are useful for countries and states where debate continues about how strict smoking bans should be, especially as hospital care for premature babies is very expensive. This is perhaps one of the most important things to know about strengthening legislation.

The program works with the HTC Vive, a virtual reality headset released earlier this year. An active shooter situation is when an armed person or people are actively shooting in a small community with the intent to kill. According to FBI statistics, there were 20 such situations in the United States last year, and 20 the year before, as a result of which 231 people died. This year saw the deadliest active shooting in US history, with 49 people killed at a nightclub in Orlando. In a learning situation, users have four options to choose from. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, for example, in an office closet. They can run for the exit. Or they might use something in the office - a computer, a cup and scissors - as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement on the standard active shooter training.

A gas car has a fuel tank that supplies gasoline to the engine. On the other hand, an electric car has a set of batteries that provides electricity to the car.

The diet has been linked to healthier old age, lower risk of heart disease, and even protection against memory loss. Education is associated with a longer life.

His findings show education should be an even more important factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to find better jobs, plan for their future, and lead healthier lives. Being a hard worker doesn't necessarily mean that stress at work is hurting you. Longevity research has shown that many hard-working people have lived long lives. \"Skeptics may wonder if working people really enjoy life.\" the authors write: \"We found that productive, hard-working people (even in old age) do not experience stress or unhappiness, but tend to be happier, healthier, and more socially connected than their less productive peers.\" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life span. We often turn to friends and family for support, and some evidence suggests that caring for those we love can help us take better care of ourselves. Some studies even show that our immune function improves when we are around friends and that they help us cope with stress.

Since it is currently impossible to assess the quality of what parents have done for their children, the next best thing is the status of the college where the child is accepted. From the point of view of a restless parent, an Ivy League college kid is proof that he is a better parent than a small college kid. Once I was sitting with a talented, weak high school girl and her brilliant parents. She, they and the school had to decide whether she should stay at the school or go to the hospital. In light of her anorexia( ), the school strongly advised her not to submit her early application to Princeton. Hearing this, the girl looked at the adults in the room and said, \"If I can't apply to Princeton sooner, I'll die.\" Her parents also really wanted her to go to Princeton. Why do they all need it so desperately? Because, in this case, something went wrong in the family. Due to some weakness in upbringing, this child was not happy and insecure. However, she was eighteen, the culture demanded that she leave home. The psychological solution for them all was a comforting vision great college . Somehow going there would improve her life and protect the upbringing of her parents' children. Similar fears about letting go of an ill-mannered child exist in all families.

Despite their real abilities, the relationship between performance and rankings was strikingly high. It seems that people work the way we expect them to. That Self-fulfilling Effect also known as the Pygmalion effect. It comes from an ancient Greek legend. The story was also the basis of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, later turned into the musical My Fair Lady. In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims he can turn a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a duchess. But, as Eliza herself points out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it's not what she teaches or does that determines whether she becomes a duchess, but how she is treated. The implications of the Pygmalion effect for leaders and managers are enormous. This means your team's performance depends less on them than on you. The performance you get from people is no more and no less than you expect, which means you should always expect the best. As Goethe said: \u201cTreat a person as he is, and he will remain as he is.

Since we cannot see what we cannot see, our lecturer was determined to catch us in the act. He made us watch a video of six people throwing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to track only the throws among the people in white. The tape rolled and everyone started counting. Everyone but me. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw the footage of confusing basketball shots, I knew I couldn't follow their movements, so I let my mind wander. However, I got curious when a gorilla walked in among the players at about 30 seconds into the recording. She (later we learned that the student was wearing a gorilla costume) stared at the camera, punched herself in the chest, and then walked away as they continued to pass the balls. When the recording stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball shots. All hands went up.

Then he asked, \"Who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to find that I was the only person at my desk and one of only three or four people in the large room who had done so. He set us up by trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, it was a trick, but he didn't play it on us. Focusing on the score, we managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is a fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe it provides us with great opportunities. My point of view is different from that of many neuroscientists: where they see human flaws, I feel an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of much of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control the various forms of attention and use them to our advantage.

The International Monetary Fund estimates that in 2009 the Russian economy will contract by 6.7 percent, while China's economy will grow by 8.5 percent and India by 5.4 percent. Brazil fared less, with a 0.7 percent drop, but it still fared much better than Russia. But BRIC is not only about the economy. As mentioned above, this is a marketing ploy that encourages investors to focus on large promising players. From an investment point of view, it can be argued that Russia leads the BRIC. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year, while three others account for about 80 percent. At the very least, despite Russia's weak economic performance, its outperforming performance in the stock market suggests that it is indeed in this group.", "qas": [{"question": "According to the passage, which country will enjoy the biggest increase in 2009?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 571, "text": "China"}], "id": "7a13950a8cec4603aac9085f2f0b9f91ru"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Vans, Keds, Dollies - they sound like the names of rock bands, but if you have teenagers, you know that these are actually the latest in teenage shoes.

Here, experts define the problems associated with the choice of shoes by teenagers. KEDS/VANS Slip-on shoes with elasticated sides are especially popular with teenage boys, with Keds and Vans being the most popular brands. The main problem is that they are too flat - so flat that the heel that first touches the ground also becomes damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are those light and thin shoes on wheels. The problem is partly in their flatness, like sneakers and vans. However, flats that do not have a lace or heel have other specific problems. \u201cBecause the shoe does not have a closure device, it relies on the toes to hold the shoe, causing a clumsy gait that leads to short and long term problems such as blisters, heel and knee pain.\u201d TANJI AND stilettos These shoes can also cause gait problems.

Something made of natural breathable fabric, with drawstrings to hold it in place, with a small heel and a deep toe box like Clark, Marks & Spencer or Rhino.

We go to school because we want to know more about the world around us. An ordinary classroom used to be a place where teachers and students worked together and explored the wonderful world of knowledge, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one such approach. Online learning is a new style that seems to be more successful than traditional learning. The Internet provides schools with a wealth of learning materials available to students online. With a choice of online courses, completing the program becomes much easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spend hours searching for the right sources. Today we have a \u201clibrary\u201d in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience as a mother for the first time, I find that using the information on the Internet is very helpful. While I am at home with my child, I can still search for the material I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving home. The Internet is not only a major provider of information, but also saves money and time. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future due to access to information via the Internet. The cost of land, buildings and teachers' salaries are constantly rising. In addition, conventional (offline) courses rely heavily on books and other paper-based materials, while online education publishes lectures and assignments electronically, saving thousands of dollars annually. Online classes and courses without physical limitations are also very convenient. In face-to-face learning, there is a limit on the number of students, while online learning is available to everyone. Students don't have to put in the effort to sign up for the classes they enjoy. Students will have more opportunities to take online courses and classes. The Internet offers an excellent opportunity to gain knowledge in a more convenient and less costly way.

I was then asked to walk towards a small plane that had just come to a slow stop on the runway. Once on the plane, he soon began to rise. I started to get nervous. When we reached a thousand meters, my teacher Harry tied a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane.
