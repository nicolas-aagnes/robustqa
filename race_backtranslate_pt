Sensor Size Along with the megapixel count, sensor size determines the overall image quality as well as the camera's low-light performance. It also determines whether the camera can electronically make the captured details larger enough to see - which causes the photos to not be clear enough to be seen when you view the photos on a larger screen. Portability \"The important thing is that the camera is not too big or heavy, and that you have a good zoom range for wide-angle and telephoto shots,\" Atherton told CNN. A good choice would be a thin and light pocket camera with a high quality built-in optical zoom. \u201cThey are very popular for travel as they are lightweight but built with a telephoto lens that can magnify up to 60 times,\u201d said Atherton.

Gray wolves are your ancestors. Scientists are pretty consistent about this.

Central Asia is the newest and best candidate, according to a large study of dogs from around the world. Laura M. Shannon and Adam R. Boyko of Cornell University and an international group of other scientists studied not only purebred dogs but also street and village dogs. Dr. Shannon analyzed three different types of DNA, Boyko said, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin of dogs, in the same way that genetic studies have traced the origin of modern humans to East Africa. The analysis, Boyko said, pointed to Central Asia as the place where \"all dogs alive today\" come from. The data don't allow precise dating of the origin, he said, but show it occurred at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson from the University of Oxford, who is leading a major international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \"It's really great to see not just the number of stray dogs, but also the geographic breadth and number of remote locations where dogs were sampled,\" he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different types of DNA and the analytical methods. Dr. Larson, who was not involved with the study, said he believes the Central Asian discovery requires further testing.

His music has influenced singers such as Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. In 1950, Muddy Waters recorded a song called \"Rolling Stone\".

This includes color images1, such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And plain text warnings now appear. Congress asked for color images1 showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada he does. But tobacco companies say the new requirements passed in June violate their constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights. Judge Leon said the FDA cannot demand the new labels before a lawsuit against the government is decided. Some experts say the process can take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers had a good chance of winning the case. He said the images must be designed to appeal to the emotions, rejecting the government's arguments that they must be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an \"obvious smoke-free agenda\". The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Children, called the decision \"wrong in science and wrong in law\". About a fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says that tobacco kills nearly six million people worldwide each year.

Earth's interior is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well goes only six miles into the crust (the center of the Earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia but reached the bottom in about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a US plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a 40-kilometer hole to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the project involved government support. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth as the rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, the rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the Earth's interior (such as the fact that there is a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as earthquake analysis. So maybe it's time for a whole new method for exploring the Earth's interior. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling. Instead, we must open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a crevice about half a mile long, a meter wide and half a mile deep (not with a shovel), but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Then he would pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crevice, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the rift deeper and deeper. The iron mass would fall for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of Earth's core, the robot sending data to the surface. Stevenson likens his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we haven't been before,\" he says. \"In all possibilities, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked Not Happening. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt just about anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a fresh look at an old problem.

It is proven that if we wear certain colors of clothes, they can change our feelings. Suppose we are feeling sad, if we wear black we might start to feel worse.

Therefore, in the next academic year, the 1st period will be as usual: sentences to paragraphing . And Term 2 will work for the 5 paragraph essay. The final 3 weeks of Term 2 will be reserved for introducing TOEFL and CEE writing. By now, if the students have done their work correctly, they should be able to write very well. As for the Latin course, I'll be posting notices around campus next week so students understand what's on offer before I actually present the course. Some students have already emailed me about the course. I'm sure you don't understand how important it is for us to open this program at our school.

It's clearly one thing and still allows for the eating out experience. I love to eat outdoors, which is why my garden table is one of my all-time favorite purchases. So I think the dividing line between things and experiences is more subtle than at first glance. However, to be happy, the most important thing is the type of purchase you made. Sometimes we can all go shopping that seems like a waste of money, like probably half the clothes in our closets, but how does that happen?' There are many reasons why this happens. The biggest thing is that we spend a lot of our time working to earn money to buy things. The problem is that we buy a lot of things that we don't really need. There's nothing worse than looking in your closet and realizing how many hours you've spent working to buy things you never use.

The problem is so serious that urgent action is needed, warns the study, led by British and Chinese researchers. The investigation surveyed 2,191 students aged between nine and 12 at nine schools in urban and rural areas of Zhejiang, a thriving coastal province in eastern China. Eighty-one percent of youths said they worried \"a lot\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by the teacher, 44 percent had been physically assaulted at least a few times - with boys more likely to be victims than girls - and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most children complained that they struggled to cope with the amount of homework assigned to them. More than a third reported headaches or abdominal pain - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported an incidence of aches or pains four times a week. The investigation, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at the Center for International Health and Development at University College London (UCL), pointed the finger at the extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the beginning of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" say the authors. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools must be introduced urgently.\" The article appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" setting for the study was Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, while the \"rural\" setting was a poor municipality in Quzhou Province, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that he says explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatic rise in prosperity, which has created \"previously unknown possibilities for upward mobility\" and in turn has fueled pressures on children to do well in school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience, and discipline. \u201cThe aspirations of many parents, who had limited educational opportunities, are now invested in their only children,\u201d he says. Previous studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are few and far between and usually come from Scandinavia. A 2008 assessment of 10 to 13 year olds in Sweden found that 21 percent of boys out of 30 percent of girls had a headache, and 17 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls experienced abdominal pain at least once. per week.", "qas": [{"question": "What mainly caused schoolchildren to suffer from psychological ill-health?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 102, "text": "classroom stress and parental pressure"}], "id": "2b5bd91c586b406e9a3b3ae74a737608pt"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "According to research released by the Nielson Company on Thursday, China has become a global tourist attraction after the Beijing Olympics.

The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on wind and solar power alone. These are solar wings and fiberglass solar panels that not only absorb sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \"We tilt our solar panels towards the sun in two planes, which increases the amount of energy we receive from the sun by 40%,\" says Dane. \"And we can also use the same structure to do other work, which is also the sail, and these wing sails really push the raft forward like a soft sail.\" Computers check the sun and wind and tilt the solar wings to capture the maximum amount of sunlight. If there is not much wind or if the day is cloudy, the energy stored in the batteries drives the electric motor for up to five hours. \u201cIf the batteries are too low, the computer turns on the generator so the boat can always meet a commercial schedule or go from point A to point B, no matter what,\u201d explains Dan.

Blocks are usually linked to particular neighborhoods; they include a music group and a lot of partygoers. Block parades have become an expressive feature of Rio's Carnival. Today, there are more than 100 and the groups increase every year. Blocks can be formed by small or large groups of revelers with a clear title.

If so, you might end up sounding like a famous BIC-ballpoint pen manufacturer. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device, the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \"Is Russia really worth the BRICs name?\" asks Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \"The Russian Balance Sheet\", thinks that Putin's and Medvedev's Russia simply does not deserve to be included alongside Brazil, India and China on the list of future economic powers. He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a low level that one has to ask whether it has any influence on the global economy compared to the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always in the last seven years, Russia has taken very few steps to improve its economy. Instead, the state has lived off oil and gas.\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7% in 2009, while China will grow by 8.5% and India by 5.4%. There are fewer arguments for Brazil, down 0.7 percent, but it is still doing much better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about the economy. As mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, one could argue that Russia is leading the BRICs.

And the ads can relieve exhausted parents by making cash donations to support schools. While parents can always turn off televisions or computers, they cannot keep advertising out of schools. This is not the first time the problem has arisen. For example, a teen news program was criticized for including advertisements in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts.

Last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow businesses to advertise in the district's schools.

Whatever our main purpose in reading, our contact with good books must never fail to give us pleasure and satisfaction. With a good book in our hands, we never need to be alone. Whether the characters are taken from real life or are purely imaginary, they can become our companions and friends. In the pages of books we can walk with the wise and the good of all lands and of all times. The people we meet in books can delight us because they resemble human friends we cherish, or because they present unknown types that we are happy to welcome as new acquaintances. Our human friends can annoy us sometimes, but the friends we make in books need never tire us with their company. By turning the page, we can dismiss them without fear of hurting their feelings. While human friends forsake us, good books are always ready to give us friendship, sympathy, and encouragement. Of all the gifts from reading books, the most valuable is experience. Few of us can travel far from home or have a wide range of experiences, but we can all lead varied lives through the pages of books. Whether we wish to escape the seemingly monotonous realities of daily routines or whether we wish to visit some distant place, a book will help us when nothing else can. To travel by book, we don't need a bank account to pay for our ticket; no airships or ocean liners or stream-line trains to transport us; no passport to enter the land of our heart's desire.

We can climb high mountains, face the dangers of an Antarctic winter or cross the scorching sands of the desert, all without difficulty.

How do these agglomeration problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which congestion appears - the flow of road traffic. Martin Treiber, from the Technical University of Dresden, Germany, has already developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham at the University of Manchester. They regarded traffic as a kind of liquid flowing through a pipe and observed how the flow changes as the fluid becomes denser. At first, the flow rate increases as the density increases, as you simply get more stuff in the same amount of time. But if the density gets too high, there is a risk of congestion and throughput drops dramatically. Treiber's model of a marathon uses the same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to a sudden shift from free flow to crowded flow. It assumes that there is a range of preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the runners' flow, knowing the \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d at each point of the route. This allows Treiber to find out how blocking might depend on race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all runners start at once (meaning that those in the back have to wait until those in front have advanced). Others assign riders to various groups according to skill and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013 because police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure runners could cross safely. It could go over a 60m wooden bridge or a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blockage caused by the various options. The model predicted that a mass match would risk an overload of runners if the bridge was used. Only by moving the starting point away from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were just a little inaccurate, there was still the risk of congestion on the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. Race organizers consulted with Treiber's team and ended up opting for this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2958, "text": "dangerous blocking"}], "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e72pt"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on income and appearances in magazines, newspapers, TV shows, and online.

Sounds unbelievable, doesn't it? Not if the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He's made a career out of building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles - and the tallest card tower in the world. How does he do it? Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely from perfectly balanced and independent playing cards. He never uses glue, tape or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick of nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps the leaves and stems maintain their shape. Bees use the same type of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store their honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. It starts with a single cell made by balancing four cards against each other to form a box. It then repeats the cell several times, expanding outwards to form the grid, which is a good foundation for a strong card structure. The bigger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Bryan sometimes uses multiple cards instead of just one to build the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he talks in classrooms, is to get your cards as close together as possible when placing your grid, making sure the cards aren't slanted. After building this solid foundation, Bryan places cards on top to make the ground for the next \"story\" in the building. He can add towers, columns, steeples or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of incredible strength. In the Letters Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \"We were in the middle of nowhere,\" Bryan recalls, \"with plenty of room to do whatever we wanted. I was always making something, using things like sticks or hay bales.\" Bryan's grandfather taught him to stack cards. Bryan's two interests - building and stacking cards - were soon combined. But stacking in his family's farmhouse was a challenge. \"Our old house had wooden floors that weren't all level,\" he says. \"And they weren't very steady. When people walked, it was like 'earthquake action'. It was a challenge to build something that didn't immediately fall.\" Bryan built tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before building something taller than him. When he placed some decks of cards on top of his railing, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's towers started to get taller. How high is too high? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992 when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a thin tower that reached 14 feet 6 inches. Made as a project for his geometry class, it took 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. He has since set world records for even taller buildings. Its last winner measured 25 feet 3.5 inches and used around 2,400 decks of cards. _ Why don't these towers fall? The key is in a good solid foundation, a repetitive pattern of stories and a tapered top. Bryan likes to point out how the card buildings resemble the real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts form a strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can't all be on top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits that it's sometimes painful to see its structures destroyed.

Asthma is a major concern as secondhand smoke damages children's airways in many ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been of Maastricht University Medical Center reviewed up to 11 studies that examined how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and premature births changed after the smoking ban. . The result shows that both asthma hospitalizations and preterm birth rates dropped by about 10% in one year after smoking restriction. The effect on preterm births may also have been caused by pregnant women being more likely to give up or cut back after a public ban, says Been. But Been also says studies haven't been able to fully prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. However, in fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, most saw health improvements. These findings are useful for countries and states where there is an ongoing debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially since hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This may be one of the most important things to know to strengthen legislation. Other studies have shown that heart attack and stroke rates also tend to drop after the introduction of a smoking ban.", "qas": [{"question": "Laws on smoking bans in public places are going stricter in     .", "answers": [{"answer_start": 349, "text": "Japan"}], "id": "ea4a403dcddb443ebab99c790c6564bbpt"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Jano India Camp Celebrate Indian culture, languages, arts, festivals and literature.

The law, due to pass this month, is likely to cause a revolution in family affairs in a country where 40 % of men reportedly do no housework at all. It will oblige men to \"share domestic responsibilities and the care and attention\" of children and elderly family members, according to the bill approved by the Spanish parliament's justice commission. \"This will be a good way to remind people what their duties are. It's something feminists have wanted for a long time,\" said Margarita Uria of the Basque Nationalist Party, which was behind amending a new divorce law. . Failure to fulfill obligations will be taken into account by judges when determining the terms of divorces. Men who refuse to do their part may have less frequent contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times more on household chores than their husbands. Even when both have jobs outside the home, Spanish women still work three times more from home. \"But it's not just about housework,\" Uria said. A study conducted five years ago by the Center for Sociological Research in Spain found that parents spend an average of 13 minutes a day caring for their children. Only 19% of Spanish men thought it was right for mothers of school-age children to have a full-time job. More than a third thought that mothers should not work outside the home. The amendment to the Spanish legal code will add domestic obligations to a list of marital duties that currently includes fidelity, coexistence and mutual help.

The excessive involvement of many parents in the process is, in my view, a cover for this deep parental anxiety: did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I needed to do for this child? Will this child have a good life?

Despite their actual abilities, there was a surprisingly high connection between performance and rankings. It seems people perform as well as we expect. O Self-fulfilling Effect It is also known as the Pygmalion Effect. This comes from an old Greek story. The story was also the basis of George Bernard Shaw's play \"Pygmalion\", later made into the musical \"My Fair Lady\". In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims that he can turn a cockney florist, Eliza Doolittle, into a duchess. But, as Eliza herself points out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it's not what she learns or does that determines whether she will become a duchess, but how she is treated. The implication of the Pygmalion Effect for leaders and managers is enormous. That means your team's performance depends less on them than it does on you. The performance you get from people is neither more nor less than what you expect, which means you should always expect the best. As Goethe said: \"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is.

A professor doing research at the medical school was talking about attention blindness, the basic feature of the human brain that, when we focus on one task, makes us miss almost everything else. Because we cannot see what we cannot see, our teacher was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people playing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to track only the plays between the people in white. The tape rolled and everyone started counting. All but me. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw that tape of the confused basketball players, I knew I wouldn't be able to follow their movements, so I let my mind wander. I was curious though, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla walked in between the players. She (we later found out that a student was dressed as a gorilla) looked at the camera, hit her chest with her fist and then walked away as they continued passing the balls. When the tape stopped, the teacher asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball plays. Hands went up everywhere. He then asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who scored the 15 . Then he asked, \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to find that I was the only person at my table and one of three or four in the great room to do so. He armed us, trapping us in our own attention-blindness. Yes, there was a trick, but he wasn't the one who played on us. By focusing so much on counting, we managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe it presents us with a great opportunity. My opinion is different from that of many neuroscientists: where they see the individual's shortcomings, I feel an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control our different forms of attention and enjoy them. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learned about how to pay attention means we're missing out on everything else.

However, ballet shoes, which do not have a string or heel, have other specific problems. \"Since the shoe has no attachment device, it relies on the toes to hold the shoe together, causing an awkward gait, which leads to short-term and long-term problems like calluses, heel and knee pain.\" WEDGES AND STILETTOS These shoes can also cause walking problems. They may look good, but the heels are so high that they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teens who wear these shoes regularly are also at risk of joining those millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES So what do podiatrists have on their bucket list, especially for everyday wear? Something in natural, breathable fabric, with a drawstring to hold it in, with a small heel and a deep toe cap that doesn't pinch your toes, like Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your child insists on wearing 'bad' shoes, put a simple foot brace on the shoes. These support and correct foot movement and, properly adjusted by a podiatrist, can often transform your walk and stop damage.", "qas": [{"question": "Of all the shoes mentioned in the passage, which can cause the worst problems?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 676, "text": "BALLET PUMPS"}], "id": "3c060f8f033345a8a16d31b89fa63d50pt"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Education plays a very important role in everyone's life. We go to school because we want to know more about the world around us. The typical classroom used to be the place where teachers and students worked and explored the wonderful world of knowledge together, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one such approach. Internet learning is a new style that seems to become more successful than traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a wealth of learning material that is accessible to students online. Due to the online course options, completing a program becomes much easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spent hours looking for the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, being a first-time mother, I find that using information online is very helpful. While I'm at home with my baby, I can still look for the material I need and exchange ideas and information with my peers without leaving the house. The Internet is not only a great provider of information, it is also a time and money saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future because of access to information over the Internet. The cost of land, construction and teachers' salaries are continually increasing. In addition, regular (offline) courses rely heavily on books and other paper materials, while online education publishes lectures and assignments electronically, which saves thousands of dollars every year. With no physical restrictions, online classes and courses are also very convenient. In classroom education, there is a limitation on the number of students, while internet education is available to everyone. Students don't have to struggle to sign up for classes they enjoy. Students will have more options to take their courses and classes online. The Internet offers a wonderful opportunity to gain knowledge in a more convenient and less expensive way.

Then I was asked to go to a small plane that had just come to a slow stop on the runway. Once on the plane, it was soon ascending. I started to get nervous. When we got to 1,000 meters, Harry, my teacher, attached a wire from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane. The line was to open my parachute after I jumped. \"Get ready, Henry,\" said Harry. I moved carefully to the door. I wanted to scream, \"No, no, no!\" but no words came. \"Jump!\" Harry yelled loudly. \"Jump!\" To my surprise, kicking like a frog, I jumped.
