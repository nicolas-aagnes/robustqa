Then a plumber, named Joe, tries to fix a major leak in the flooded basement. However, he is killed by a presence that emerged from behind a thin wall. The mood at the hotel is further cooled by creepy-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who are apparently coming with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. Apparently it's that of Schweik, the artist. Driving down the 14-mile causeway towards New Orleans, Liza comes across a strange blind woman, standing in the middle of the desolate highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, even though her eyes are covered by cataracts. Liza takes Emily to her lavishly furnished home in New Orleans. Emily warns Liza to leave the hotel while she can. Meanwhile, in the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe is performing an autopsy on Joe the plumber, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs and leaves for lunch, while Harris stays behind to set up the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins to pulse with activity. A little later, Joe's wife, Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi), arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for her funeral, when she is murdered. horribly by acid scalding. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss her doubts and anxieties. She expresses puzzlement when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims that he had never heard of them before despite knowing everyone in the area. A phone call then arrives from Harris' bar informing John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner scared and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears to Liza again that night at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in room 36 of the hotel, and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of the Seven Gates of Hell, and Schweik has been the Guardian. Emily is about to reveal more of herself when her hands rest on a canvas that represents a desolate vision of lost souls in a terrible and barren landscape. Suddenly scared, Emily says that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel room into the night. But Liza realizes a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily didn't step on the bare wooden boards as she ran, and neither did her guide dog. The next day, Liza nervously ventures into room 36, a dirty ghost of sheets. covered furniture and dusty beams of light.

Simon (Logan Lerman), 17, plays/controls Kable and guides him through the factory. After killing almost everyone in his path, Kable is thrown out of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterwards, the surviving characters are transported to another location. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, as he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't think anyone will be released from the game. The Gina Parker Smith Show's producer (Michael Weston) and chief of staff Bob (John de Lancie) talk about their next guest on the show: genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the accomplishments of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). She first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game, but instead of controlling a fake character, players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control another person, or you can be paid to be controlled. The partnership quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago, Castle created Slayers, a controversial game that is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that all of the game's characters, while real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game rather than serve their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, he will be set free (although no one has survived that long). Some convicts are sent to battlefields with pre-designed actions to perform, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to fight back (causing their mortality rate to be extremely high). Additionally, all games are televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has nanocells implanted in their brains, making it possible for someone else to control them. They can only be controlled on the perimeter of the game (i.e. after the game ends, they regain control). After the show ends, the signal is hacked by the Humanz, a resistance group. The humans Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this path. Castle is amused and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape, but ultimately fails. Kable sits alone and thinks of his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable scares everyone else when he sits alone and is constantly thinking. He can't believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks why he is in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later, while he is sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot in the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other end knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. He has Kable sign an autograph for his son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph. Elsewhere, we see Kable's wife, Angie (Amber Valletta), working as a character. in society. Virtually every character in the game is dressed in skimpy, ridiculous costumes.", "qas": [{"question": "Who convinces Simon?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2707, "text": "Brother"}], "id": "ebefc7eee1e64feb976e77709b95bdcd0es"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Early one morning, a cab pulls up to Tiffany & Co. on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where elegantly dressed Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) emerges.
