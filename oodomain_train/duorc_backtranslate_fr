A short time later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is gruesomely killed by scald at the 'acid. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss her apprehensions and anxieties. He expresses bewilderment when Lisa complains about the incompetence of her strange minions. John claims to have never heard of them before, although he knows everyone in the area. Then a phone call from the bar comes in from Harris who informs John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found cowering in a corner scared and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears to Liza again that night at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the wizard Schweik, who stayed in the hotel's room 36, and about the supernatural underworld the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of the Seven Gates of Hell, and Schweik served as its guardian. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over a canvas depicting a desolate vision of souls lost in a terrible, barren landscape. Suddenly frightened, Emily says the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel lounge into the night.

Brink comes later for Gramps (Lionel Barrymore). Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the grumpy old grandfather orders Mr. Brink to vacate the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Grandpa is surprised and relieved that someone else can see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or an apparition.\nPud tells Grandpa that when he makes a good deed , he can make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Grandpa wants anyone who climbs his apple tree to stay there until he allows them to come down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he struggles to descend the tree himself, only becoming free when Grandpa says he can.\nAunt Demetria (Eily Malyon), Pud's affair, has plans for Pud and the money his parents left him. Grandpa spends a lot of time putting off his efforts to adopt the boy.\nBrink takes Granny Nellie (Beulah Bondi) to a peaceful death just after finishing some knitting. When Mr. Brink returns again for Gramps, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud in Demetria, Grandpa tricks Mr. Brink into climbing the apple tree. While he's stuck in the tree, he can't take Grandpa or anyone else. The only way anyone or anything can die is if they touch Mr. Brink or the apple tree.\nDemetria plots to have Gramps committed to a mental hospital when he claims death is trapped in his apple tree. Gramps first proves his story by proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans (Henry Travers), cannot even kill a fly they have caught. He offers further proof of his power by shooting Mr. Grimes (Nat Pendleton), the orderly who has come to take him to the asylum; Grimes lives when he should have died.\nDr. Evans is now a believer, but he tries to convince Gramps to drop death so that those who suffer can find liberation. Gramps refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to hire Gramps while Pud is returned to Demetria's custody. With the help of his governess (Una Merkel), Grandpa tricks them both into believing that they have to accompany Mr. Brink when he comes down from the tree. They beg Grandpa to convince Brink otherwise, and Demetria swears never to bother Grandpa or Pud again.\nGrandpa realizes that sooner or later he will have to let Brinks down - death is ultimately an inevitable part of life. He tries to say goodbye to Pud, who reacts angrily and tries to run away. Mr. Brink sees Pud in the yard and challenges him to climb the tree. Pud climbs over the fence Gramps had built around the tree, but falls and is paralyzed for life. Distraught, Grandpa lets Death come down from the tree.

That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly rushes to his cabin, where he pulls a shotgun from its mount and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant relapses into post-trauma memories of a nightmare he experienced in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A-4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine-gunned his captors. . Gant suffered personal trauma when an overhead A-4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood too long watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The following scenes are round trips between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing led by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS regarding the Soviet Union's latest fighter/interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" Model 31, named \"Firefox\" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, two engines each delivering 50,000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling over 100,000 feet, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, that is). is not nothing), and an armament and defense system capable of reading the pilot's thoughts and allowing him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus giving him a reaction time advantage 3 to 5 seconds on any opponent. NATO's decision is to send Gant to fly a Firefox prototype right next to the Soviet Bilyarsk development base near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is quite simply the victim of blackmail; he was allowed to live on government land which will now be sold to him if he does not accept the assignment. The NATO air force attach (Thomas Hill) resents him too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, even worse, is prone to post-stress stress disorder. traumatic and can crack at any time. They only use Gant for two reasons: he is fluent in Russian and is a perfect match for the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's first test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff). Gant goes through several weeks of refresher training, both in flight and aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to smuggle heroin in the Soviet Union. After his training is complete, he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his goals and he is disguised with a new haircut and fake mustache. Gant is also familiar with the underground network group, made up mostly of Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way guidance device disguised as a cheap transistor radio.

After 2E leaves, Holly walks into Paul's apartment and learns that he is a writer who hasn't published anything since a vignette book five years prior. Holly, in turn, explains that she is trying to save money to support her brother Fred when he gets out of the military. The couple fall asleep, but wake up when Holly has a nightmare about Fred. She later buys Paul a typewriter ribbon as an apology and invites him to a party at her apartment. There, Paul meets his Hollywood agent, O. J.

As they get out of the cab, they tip the driver generously, bribing him not to tell anyone about them. Alice and Judson check the departure sign for The Silver Queen, heading to Panama City, Panama, and look excited and anxious. Peggy Nolan is also waiting for the same flight, to whom a delivery of expensive flowers is made along with a card thanking her for a favor. Peggy dismissively throws the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a seller of cheap gardenias. Shortly after, the flight prepares to depart and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a domineering woman, but her husband seems happy to be ruled like a child. As they wait on the tarmac near the plane, a car pulls up and a well-dressed man emerges from it with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is sent away with \"Uncle\" Pete until his father - a mobster - can follow later. As the passengers board, Bill, the pilot, learns that they are going to bring an anarchist back to Panama. , but he assures the group that there is nothing to worry about since the man will be in custody during the robbery.\nThe prisoner is Vasquez and is accompanied by a bounty hunter named Crimp. After Larry, the steward, helps everyone settle in, the flight departs with its twelve souls on board. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the layover and Joe indicates that he is interested in Alice. He returns to the passenger compartment where the beds have been made and people are going to bed for the night - except for Crimp who plans to stay up and make sure Vasquez doesn't \"go for a walk\" - thus tricking the executioner and himself on $5,000. Pete tucks in his young protege for the night and helps him say his prayers (something Pete doesn't know). Peggy climbs into the cockpit to visit Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice rings for the steward, Joe takes the call and does a play for her. The next morning, the plane arrives for a refueling stop in Mexico and the passengers eat breakfast. Joe continues to pursue Alice, under the assumption that she is Judson's secretary. Peggy does another swipe for Bill to warm up to her and is pushed back again. Then Pete tells her that her help isn't needed when she tries to get Tommy to drink his milk.
