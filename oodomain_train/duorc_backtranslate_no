Schweik is accused of being a wizard, and is dragged down to the basement where he is brutally beaten with heavy chains, tortured with burnt lime acid and crucified with his wrists nailed to a basement wall, despite his serious warnings of evil to be unleashed. Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who comes from New York City to claim the hotel as her legacy. Not long ago, the architect's friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) started showing her around the property, strange events begin to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his rig and is terribly injured, coughs up blood and babbles about \"the eyes, the eyes\". Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) comes to take the injured man to the hospital, and gives Liza some sympathy. Then a plumber, named Joe, tries to repair a large leak in the flooded basement. However, he is murdered by a presence that appeared behind a slender wall. The atmosphere of the hotel is further cooled by the sinister servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's dead body in the basement, and another much older corpse lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. That's apparently it for Schweik, the artist. As Liza drives down the 140-mile highway to New Orleans, Liza meets a strangely blind woman standing in the middle of the deserted highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller), and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, even though her eyes are clogged with cataracts. Liza drives Emily to her lavishly furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile, at the hospital's morgue, Dr. John McCabe performs the autopsy of plumber Joe while assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's body. John laughs at it and goes to lunch, while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins to pulsate with activity. A little later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress up her husband's body for the funeral, as she is killed in a horrific manner of scalding with acid . Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets John McCabe in a bar downtown to discuss her concerns and concerns. He expresses confusion when Lisa complains about the iniquity of her strange servants. John claims to have never heard of them before despite knowing everyone in the area. Then comes a phone call from the bar from Harris informing John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily reappears for Liza that night at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the wizard Schweik, who lived in room 36 at the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of the gates of the Seven Hells, and Schweik has been the Guardian. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over to a canvas depicting a deserted vision of lost souls in a terrible and dry landscape.

Martha discovers Joe's dead body in the basement, and another much older corpse lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. That's apparently it for Schweik, the artist. As Liza drives down the 140-mile highway to New Orleans, Liza meets a strangely blind woman standing in the middle of the deserted highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller), and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, even though her eyes are clogged with cataracts. Liza drives Emily to her lavishly furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile, at the hospital's morgue, Dr. John McCabe performs the autopsy of plumber Joe while assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's body. John laughs at it and goes to lunch, while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins to pulsate with activity. A little later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) comes with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress up her husband's body for the funeral, when she is killed in a terrible way by the scald of acid. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets John McCabe in a bar downtown to discuss her concerns and concerns. He expresses confusion when Lisa complains about the iniquity of her strange servants. John claims to have never heard of them before despite knowing everyone in the area. Then comes a phone call from the bar from Harris informing John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily reappears for Liza that night at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the wizard Schweik, who lived in room 36 at the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of the gates of the Seven Hells, and Schweik has been the Guardian. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over to a canvas depicting a deserted vision of lost souls in a terrible and dry landscape. Suddenly scared, Emily says that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel lounge last night. But Liza notices a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily did not fall on the bare wooden planks while running, nor did her sighted dog. The next day, Liza ventures nervously into room 36, a dingy fantasy painting of sheet-covered furniture and shafts of dusty candles.

Its capabilities seem extraterrestrial: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50,000 pounds of thrust, 100,000-foot-plus throttle, speeds above Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and capable of sustaining it, no small feat), and a weapon and defense system capable of reading the pilot's thoughts and allowing him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus giving him a 3- to 5-second reaction time advantage over any opponent.

Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he's gone, Mrs. Padde kidnaps Thommelise from her bed and takes her away.\nThumbelina wakes up on Mrs. Toad's show boat. Mrs. Padde wants Tommelise to join their squad and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Tommelise alone on a lily pillow to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the narrator of the film), overhears Tommelise's cry for help and sets her free. Jacquimo's friends, jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo goes to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius finds out about Tommelise's kidnapping and sets out to find her.\nWhile trying to get home, Thumbelina is attacked by Berkeley Beetle, who scares away jitterbugs. He's in love with her song, and promises to show her the way home if she sings on the Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she is poorly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her.\nWinter is approaching. Jacquimo accidentally spits his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and after some conviction from Beetle, he decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him as Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius.\nThumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is dead. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole which tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier that day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, whom Thumbelina discovers is unconscious. Mr. Mole wants to marry Thumbelina; crushed over Cornelius' death, Tommelise agrees. Jacquimo wakes up under Thumbelina's care and goes to find Cornelius, refusing to believe that he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle Cornelius brings his frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius' body.\nAt the wedding, Tommelise realizes at the last minute that she can not marry someone she does not love and refuses to make the vows. Grundel and Beetle crash the wedding, but Thumbelina escapes from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius cuts off the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing battle results in them both falling into an abyss.

They leave Tommelise alone on a lily pillow to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the narrator of the film), overhears Tommelise's cry for help and sets her free. Jacquimo's friends, jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo goes to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius finds out about Tommelise's kidnapping and sets out to find her.\nWhile trying to get home, Thumbelina is attacked by Berkeley Beetle, who scares away jitterbugs. He's in love with her song, and promises to show her the way home if she sings on the Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she is poorly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her.\nWinter is approaching. Jacquimo accidentally spits his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and after some conviction from Beetle, he decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him as Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius.\nThumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is dead. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole, who tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier that day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, whom Thumbelina discovers is unconscious. Mr. Mole wants to marry Thumbelina; crushed over Cornelius' death, Tommelise agrees. Jacquimo wakes up under Thumbelina's care and goes to find Cornelius, refusing to believe that he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle Cornelius brings his frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius' body.\nAt the wedding, Tommelise realizes at the last minute that she can not marry someone she does not love and refuses to make the vows. Grundel and Beetle crash the wedding, but Thumbelina escapes from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius cuts off the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing battle results in them both falling into an abyss. Once out and about, Tommelise is reunited with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Valley of the Fairies. Cornelius shows up after surviving the fall, the couple is reunited, and Tommelise accepts his proposal for marriage. The two kiss, and Thumbelina gets her own wings.\nWith Tommelise's mother and the ferret present, Tommelise and Cornelius are married and go on a honeymoon on Cornelius' hops. Photos shown during the studies reveal that Beetle resumed her singing career and had regained her wings, Ms. Fieldmouse married Mr. Mole, and Grundel also survived the fall with minor injuries and married a female toad (which suggested he lost interest in Thumbelina).", "qas": [{"question": "Who brings the swallow a blanket?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 217, "text": "Thumbelina"}], "id": "7ac12752a2cb4ad99557c300fe095a611no"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "A lonely old woman who longs for a child gets a seed from a good witch.
