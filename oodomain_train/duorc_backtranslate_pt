A painter (Anthony Flees) falls out of his equipment and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and muttering \"eyes, eyes\". Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza some sympathy. Then a plumber named Joe tries to fix a large leak in the flooded basement. However, he is murdered by a presence that has emerged from behind a thin, hardened wall. The atmosphere at the hotel is further chilled by the creepy-looking employees Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a puddle of dirty water nearby. Apparently it's that of Schweik, the artist. Driving down the 22-kilometer sidewalk to New Orleans, Liza encounters a strange blind woman standing in the middle of the deserted road. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller), and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, even though her eyes are blocked by cataracts. Liza takes Emily to her opulently furnished home in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to get out of the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile, in the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe is performing the autopsy on Joe the plumber, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs and leaves for lunch, while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine starts pulsing with activity. A little later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is gruesomely killed by scalding with acid . Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets with John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss her doubts and anxieties.

Then, a phone call from the bar arrives from Harris, who informs John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found cowering in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears again for Liza that night at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the sorcerer Schweik, who stayed in Room 36 at the hotel, and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel hides.

Meanwhile, in the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe is performing the autopsy on Joe the plumber, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse.

He expresses bewilderment when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims to have never heard of them before, despite knowing everyone in the area. Then, a phone call from the bar arrives from Harris, who informs John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found cowering in a corner frightened and unable to speak.

Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander across a screen that shows a desolate vision of lost souls in a terrible, barren landscape. Suddenly scared, Emily says the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel's hall into the night. But Liza realizes an unsettling fact about her sudden departure: Emily didn't step on the bare wooden boards as she ran, nor did her guide dog. covered furniture and dusty light beams.

Pud inadvertently tests desire when he himself has trouble getting down from the tree, becoming free only when Grandpa says he can.\nPud's nosy aunt Demetria (Eily Malyon) has plans for Pud and the money left behind by her parents. Grandpa spends a lot of time avoiding her efforts to adopt the boy.\nBrink leads Granny Nellie (Beulah Bondi) to a peaceful death shortly after she finishes some knitting. When Mr. Brink returns to grandpa again, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud to Demetria, Grampa tricks Mr. Brink to climb the apple tree. While trapped in the tree, he cannot take Grandpa or anyone else. The only way for anyone or anything to die is to touch Mr. Brink or in the apple tree.\nDemetria plans to have grandpa committed to a mental hospital when he claims that Death is trapped in his apple tree. Grandpa proves his story by first proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans (Henry Travers), can't even kill a fly they've caught. He offers further proof of his power by shooting Mr. Grimes (Nat Pendleton), the orderly who came to take him to the asylum; Grimes lives when he should have died.\nDr. Evans is now a believer, but he tries to convince Grandpa to let Death down so that people who are suffering can find deliverance. Grandpa refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to lock Grandpa while Pud is handed over to Demetria's custody. With the help of his housekeeper (Una Merkel), Grandpa tricks the two into believing they are scheduled to go with Mr. Brink when he comes down from the tree. They beg Grampa to convince Brink otherwise, and Demetria vows never to bother Grampa or Pud again.\nGrandpa realizes that sooner or later he will have to let Brinks down - death is an inevitable part of life. He tries to say goodbye to Pud, who reacts angrily and tries to run away. Mr. Brink sees Pud in the backyard and challenges him to climb the tree. Pud climbs over the fence Grandpa built around the tree, but falls and is crippled for life. Distraught, Grandpa lets Death descend from the tree. He picks up Grampa and Pud, who discover they can walk again. In the final scene, they walk together down a beautiful country road and hear Grandma Nellie calling out to them in a bright light.", "qas": [{"question": "What did he have to do to get the wish?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 454, "text": "good deed"}], "id": "7a4d0d23a0fa459e9f1701cd965f22df0pt"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "A Huey helicopter soars over the Alaskan wilderness, its pilots looking for someone below.

Holly, in turn, explains that she is trying to save up to support her brother Fred when he leaves the Army. The two fall asleep, but are awakened when Holly has a nightmare about Fred. She later buys Paul a typewriter ribbon to apologize and invites him to a party at his apartment. There, Paul meets his Hollywood agent, O.J. Berman (Martin Balsam), who describes Holly's transformation from country girl to Manhattan socialite. He is also introduced to Jos da Silva Pereira (Jos Luis de Vilallonga), a wealthy Brazilian politician, and Rusty Trawler (Stanley Adams), the \"ninth richest man in America under 50\".\nIn the days that follow, Paul and Holly grow closer. One day, 2E enters Paul's apartment, worried that she is being followed. Paul tells her that he will investigate and eventually confronts Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen), Holly's ex-husband. Doc explains that Holly's real name is Lula Mae Barnes. They got married when she was 13, and he wants to take her back to Texas since Fred will be back. After Paul reunites Holly and Doc, she tells Paul that the marriage has been annulled. At the bus station, she tells Doc that she won't go with him. Doc leaves with a broken heart.\nAfter drinking at a club, Paul and Holly return to her apartment, where she drunkenly tells him that she plans to marry Trawler for his money. A few days later, Paul discovers that one of his short stories will be published. On his way to tell Holly, he sees a newspaper headline informing him that Trawler has married someone else. Holly and Paul agree to spend the day together, taking turns doing things they've never done before. At Tiffany's, Paul has Doc Golightly's Cracker Jack box ring engraved as a gift for Holly. After spending the night together, he wakes up to find her gone. When 2E arrives, Paul ends their relationship. She calmly accepts, having previously concluded that he and Holly are in love.\nHolly plans to marry Jos for his money, which angers Paul. After Holly receives a telegram notifying her of Fred's death, she destroys her apartment. Months later, Paul moved out. He is invited to dinner by Holly, who leaves the next morning for Brazil to continue her relationship with Jos. However, they are arrested in connection with Sally Tomato's drug ring, and Holly spends the night in prison.\nThe next morning, Holly is released on bail and finds Paul waiting, and they take a cab. He has his cat and a letter from Jos explaining that he must end their relationship due to her arrest.

He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, after destroying it. The opening song is not by Pink Floyd, but is Vera Lynn's recording of \"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's childhood. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout her childhood, Pink yearns for a father figure after she discovers her father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher learns from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \"Money\" from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon album. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him everything he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually marries as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife break up and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink discovers the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic goods and turns to a groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to destroy him in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly starts to lose her mind to metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared on a recording session of Wish You Were Here in 1975, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, transforms into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him to a limousine waiting outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to allow him to perform. Drugs make Pink hallucinate and he fantasizes that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his show is a rally. His followers go on to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \"Waiting for the Worms\". The scene is punctuated by images of animated hammers marching over the ruins. Rose yells \"Stop!\" and takes refuge in a bathroom at the concert venue, reciting poems that would later be used as lyrics in Pink Floyd's \"Your Possible Pasts\" from The Final Cut album and \"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity)\" by Roger Waters' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. In an animated weather sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is described as a small pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two legs facing backwards, an anus for a mouth, and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulture-like man, and the schoolmaster is an abusive and hateful puppet.
