Sensor size Together with the megapixel number, the size of the sensor dictates the overall image quality as well as the camera's performance in low light. It also determines if the camera can electronically set the details it captures larger enough to see - which is why the images are not clear enough to see when you see the images on a larger screen. Portability \"The important thing is that the camera is not too big or heavy, and that you have a good zoom range for both wide-angle and telephoto,\" Atherton told CNN. A good choice would be a narrow, lightweight pocket camera with a high-quality built-in optical zoom. \"These are very popular for travel because they are lightweight, but built with a telephoto lens that can zoom up to 60 times,\" Atherton said. Zoom and shutter speed For action or audience shots, fast shutter speed is a key factor. \"When dealing with everything that is active - wildlife or people moving in the street - faces change in a matter of seconds,\" said Arnold, \"a fast shutter speed is helpful in taking the hundreds of pictures you may need to get the only profit shot. \"", "qas": [{"question": "What will contribute to a satisfactory photo of a running lion in the wild?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 991, "text": "shutter speed"}], "id": "b972e2ba473a4974bc7573f4de739abc0sv"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "My grandmother seems to be wrong when she says that good behavior will never go out of style.

Gray wolves are their ancestors. Researchers are pretty consistent about that. And researchers have suggested that the origin of dogs may go back to Europe, the Far East, Siberia and southern China. Central Asia is the newest and best candidate, according to a large study of dogs from around the world. Laura M. Shannon and Adam R. Boyko at Cornell University, and an international group of other researchers, studied not only purebred dogs but also street or village dogs. Dr. Shannon analyzed three different types of DNA, said Dr. Boyko, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin of dogs in much the same way that genetic studies have located the origins of modern humans in East Africa. The analysis, said Dr Boyko, pointed to Central Asia, as the place where \"all dogs living today\" come from. The data did not allow exact dating of the origin, he said, but showed that it occurred at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson at Oxford University, who is leading a major international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \"It's really amazing to see not only the number of stray dogs, but also the geographical breadth and the number of remote locations where the dogs were sampled,\" he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different types of DNA and the methods of analysis. Dr Larson, who was not involved in the study, said he believed the findings from Central Asia required further testing.

His music influenced singers such as Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. In 1950, Muddy Waters recorded a song called \"Rolling Stone\".

These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And now simple text warnings appear. Congress demanded color1 pictures showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada makes. But tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate their freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution. Judge Leon said the FDA could not demand the new labels before a lawsuit against the government is decided. Some experts say the process can take years. The judge said he thought the cigarette makers were very likely to win their case. He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, and rejected the government's argument that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an \"obvious anti-smoking agenda?\" The head of an anti-smoking group, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision \"a mistake in science and a mistake in the law\".

The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest source of oil enters just six miles into the earth's crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian researchers dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but reached the bottom roughly 7.5 miles under the surface. The Mohole project, an American plan in the 1950s, required drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the project involved state aid. It becomes harder and harder to drill deep into the ground as rocks become softer and softer. Hard but easy to crush at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. The little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there is a crust, a mantle and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method of exploring the earth's interior. Researcher David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a mile long, a yard wide and a mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion the size of a nuclear bomb. He then poured a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would sink for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth's core, the robot sends out data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we've not been before,\" he says. \"With all the possibilities, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the box labeled Isn't Going To Happen.

In response to these people, a lot of research has been done on what happens to someone's feelings when they are asked to wear only one color1 clothing. It has been proven that if we wear special colors on clothes, they can change our emotions. Suppose we feel sad, if we wear black we can start to feel worse.

The problem is so big that urgent action is needed, the study warns, led by British and Chinese researchers. The survey surveyed 2,191 students between the ages of nine and 12 in nine schools in Zhejiang, a very prosperous coastal province in eastern China. 81 percent of young people said they were \"very worried\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had been physically bullied at least sometimes - with boys more likely to be victims than girls - and 73 percent had been physically bullied. physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained that they had difficulty coping with the amount of homework they received. Over a third reported headaches or abdominal pain - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported aches or pains four times a week. The study, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at the University College London (UCL) Center for International Health and Development, pointed to extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the beginning of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" the authors say. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress for children in schools should be introduced urgently.\" The essay is published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" environment for the study was Hangzhou, Zhejiang's provincial capital, while the \"rural\" environment was a poor county in Quzhou Prefecture, in the western part of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that, according to it, explain the requirements for academic excellence and intolerance of failures. One factor is the country's dramatic increase in prosperity, which has created \"previously enormous opportunities for upward mobility\" and in turn increased the pressure on children to do well in school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and the Confucian traditions of respect for parents and the elderly, reverent piety, obedience and discipline. \"The aspirations of many parents, who themselves had limited educational opportunities, are now being invested in their only child,\" it says. Previous studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are few and generally come from Scandinavia. An assessment from 2008 among 10- to 13-year-olds in Sweden showed that 21 percent of the boys out of 30 percent of the girls experienced headaches, and 17 percent of the boys and 28 percent of the girls experienced abdominal pain at least once a week.", "qas": [{"question": "What mainly caused schoolchildren to suffer from psychological ill-health?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 88, "text": "classroom stress and parental pressure"}], "id": "2b5bd91c586b406e9a3b3ae74a7376080sv"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "According to a survey released by the Nielson Company on Thursday, China has become a global tourist attraction after the Beijing Olympics.

The ferry can go up to 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. It is solar wings and solar panels in fiberglass that not only take in sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \"We angle our solar panels towards the sun in two planes, which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\" says Dane. \"And we too can use the same structure to do another job, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually propel the ferry forward just like a soft sail does.\" Computers control the sun and wind and angle the sun wings to take in the most sunlight. If it is not very windy or if it is a cloudy day, the energy stored in the batteries drives the electric motor for up to five hours. \"If the batteries are too low, the computer turns on the generator so that the boat can always meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,\" explains Dan. Dane got his idea for the sun sailor from a book about insects.

The modern Brazilian carnival dates back to Rio de Janeiro in 1641. It originally copied the European form of the festival, and later incorporated parts of Native American and African cultures.

Today, they are known as blocks, consisting of a group of people who dress in costumes or special T-shirts with themes or logos. Blocks are generally connected to special neighborhoods; they include both a music group and many partygoers. Block parades have become an expressive element in Rio's carnival. Today they are more than 100 and the groups increase every year. Blocks can be formed by small or large groups of partygoers with a clear title.

If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ballpoint pen BIC. One argument is made that Goldman Sachs' famous marketing unit, the BRICs, really should be the BICs. \"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \"The Russian Balance Sheet\", thinks that Putin's and Medvedev's Russia is not worth including together with Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic power packages. He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one has to ask whether it has anything to say at all in the global economy, compared to the other members of its group. I have just returned home from Moscow, \"which is always sad this season. In the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has lived on oil and gas.\" Financially, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow by 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There are smaller cases for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still much better than Russia. But BRIC is not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing tool to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it can be argued that Russia leads the BRIC.

But how can you protect a child from a large fast food advertisement painted on her school locker? Or a toy ad on the side of his school bus? As school budgets shrink, a growing number of schools in the United States sell advertising space on lockers and buses and in gyms or cafes. It's an easy way for schools to make money. And ads can provide relief to exhausted parents by donating cash to support schools. Although parents can always turn off TVs or computers, they can not advertise outside of schools. This is not the first time the problem has occurred. For example, a news program for teens has been criticized for including ads in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts. And parent groups successfully fought against a plan from a company called Bus Radio to put music and ads in school buses. But now it's different. Just last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow businesses to advertise in district schools. Officials say the plan could provide as much as $ 18 million to schools. In St. Francis, Minn., Schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their cabinets with advertisements. Time says. Edward Saxton, a teacher at the school, says: \"So far, parents have accepted this as a way to raise the necessary money. The money pays for programs such as art, sports and music. Parents do not like to see programs get cut. Neither do I. In addition, schools are thinking about the effects on children all the time. \"But Susan Linn, an education expert, says:\" Children have already seen enough advertisements on TV, in newspapers and the products they use daily.

Whatever our main purpose of reading, our contact with good books should never fail to give us enjoyment and satisfaction. With a good book in our hands, we never have to be alone. Whether the characters in it are taken from real life or are purely imaginary, they can become our companions and friends. On the pages of the books we can walk with the wise and the good in all countries and at all times. The people we meet in books can rejoice either because they resemble human friends we love or because they present unknown types that we are happy to welcome as new acquaintances. Our human friends can sometimes bore us, but the friends we make in books never have to tire us out with their company. By turning leaves, we can dismiss them without fear of hurting their feelings. While human friends abandon us, good books are always ready to give us friendship, sympathy and encouragement. By all gifts from reading books, the most valuable is experience. Few of us can travel far from home or have a wide range of experiences, but we can all live a varied life through the pages of books. Whether we want to escape from the seemingly sad reality of daily routines or we long to visit some remote place, a book will help us when nothing else can.

What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 meters thick. The hot volcano heats the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between the glacier and the volcano and keeps it stable. When the water flows out under the glacier, the pressure increases. The lava from the volcano then comes to the surface. That is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's largest airlines, aircraft cannot fly under the cloud or over it.

But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that can be a daunting prospect. \"I have to admit that I was completely frustrated with the blockage and I stayed for 18-19 miles just away from people and was kept up,\" complained one participant after the London Marathon in 2012. \"I had to run over many people and it ended with bruises in forearms from all elbows \", said another. How do such congestion problems arise and can they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system where queues occur - the flow of road traffic. Martin Treiber, from the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flows. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his associate Gerard Whitham from Manchester University. They regarded traffic as a kind of liquid that flows down a pipe and watched how the flow changes as the liquid becomes denser. Initially, the flow increases as the density increases, as you simply get through more things in the same time period. But if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of stoppage and the flow drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses the same principle that the flow first increases and then decreases when the density of runners increases, thanks to a sudden change from free to narrow flow. He assumes that there are a number of different preferred speeds for different runners, each of which holds throughout the race. With only these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow of runners, with knowledge of the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to find out how blocking may be due to the competition conditions - for example for different starting procedures. Some marathons start with all runners leaving at once (which means that they have to wait at the back until they have advanced in front). Others divide runners into different groups according to ability and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, as the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could pass safely. It can pass either over a 60 meter long wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blockage caused by the various alternatives. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the assumed figures in the model were only slightly incorrect, there was still a risk of stopping at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed probable for the tunnel road. The race organizers consulted Treiber's team and eventually chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2952, "text": "dangerous blocking"}], "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e720sv"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on income and appearances in magazines, newspapers, TV shows and online.

Sounds incredible, right? Not if the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He has made a career of building fantastic card houses, arenas, capitals, castles - and the world's tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan's structures are fantastic because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, independent playing cards. He never uses glue, tape or anything else to hold the cards together. He does not fold the cards either. He has discovered another way to create a strong house of cards with the help of a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems retain their shape. Bees use the same type of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids and uses cards to create a recurring pattern of cells. He starts with a single cell made by balancing four cards against each other to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over again and expands outwards to form the grid, which forms a good basis for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells the children when he talks in the classrooms, is to place your cards as close together as possible when laying out your grid, and make sure the cards do not tilt at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays short over the top to make the floor for the next \"story\" in the building. He can add towers, columns, towers or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures with amazing strength. In the cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big, old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \"We were in the middle of nowhere,\" Bryan recalls, \"with plenty of room to do what we wanted. I always did something, used things like sticks or hay bales.\" Bryan's grandfather taught him how to lay cards. Bryan's two interests - building and stacking cards - were soon united. But stacking in the family farm was challenging. \"Our old house had wooden floors that were not completely level,\" he reports. \"And they were not very determined. When people walked around, it was like 'earthquake action.' It was a challenge to build something that would not fall immediately.\" Bryan constructed tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before building anything taller than himself. When he placed some decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's tower began to grow taller. How long is too long? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Bryan was told that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches and built a narrow tower that topped at 14 feet 6 inches. Performed as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then, he has won world records for even taller buildings. His latest winner measured 25 feet 3.5 inches and used about 2,400 decks of cards. Why do not these towers fall down? The key lies in a good solid base, a recurring pattern of stories and a tapered top. Bryan likes to point out how card buildings look like real ones. They are built cell by cell, history by history. The separate parts make a strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can not be on top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits that sometimes it's painful to see his structures destroyed. But he compares his work to building a sand castle or an ice sculpture.", "qas": [{"question": "What was Bryan's first world record?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2799, "text": "tallest card tower"}], "id": "2cd451e43d8a4324a58402fe091140170sv"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "A study indicates that although most students at British universities are happy with their courses, dissatisfaction has increased as fees rise.

The finding should remove fears that such laws may have the opposite effect as they may lead to people smoking more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places in recent years. At the same time, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of the US states have extensive bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer countries. Opponents often argue that bans can lead to people smoking more at home, which would be worse for their children's health. Asthma is one of the main problems as passive smoking damages children's airways in several ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Center reviewed as many as 11 studies examining how hospitalizations for childhood asthma and preterm birth changed after smoking bans. The studies included more than 2.5 million births and nearly 250,000 hospitalizations for asthma. The results show that both asthma admissions and premature birth rates fell by about 10 percent within a year after smoking restrictions were implemented. The effect on premature babies may also have been caused by pregnant women being more likely to quit or shrink after a public ban, Been says. But Been also says that the studies could not fully prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. But in fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, and most saw health improvements. Such findings are useful for countries and states where there is a debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially as hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This can be one of the most important things to know to strengthen the law.

This is the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees in how to handle an active shooting situation in the workplace. The app works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset that was released earlier this year. An active shooting situation is when one or more armed persons actively shoot in a small, populated area with the intention of killing. There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, which resulted in a total of 231 deaths. This year, the deadliest active shooter in US history occurred, with 49 people killed at a nightclub in Orlando. In the training situation, users have four choices. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, perhaps in the office closet. They can run after an exit. Or they can use something in the office - a computer or a mug, a pair of scissors - as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement on standard training for active shooters. Gallo says, that usually teaches people to lock themselves in place and hide. The \"lock down\" method is common ineffective , he says, and has resulted in many deaths in recent years. In the basic level of education, no one is killed. But as the training becomes more advanced, players who make the wrong choice are pushed. There is no blood; the screen simply slowly turns black. If this sounds scary, it's the point, says Gallo. There are plenty of training programs to teach employees how to deal with violence in the workplace, sometimes involving role-playing games with toy guns. But these workouts are basically games.

Most hybrid cars on the road right now are petrol-electric hybrids. The petrol-electric hybrid car is exactly what it sounds like - a cross between a petrol-powered car and an electric car. A petrol-powered car has a fuel tank that delivers petrol to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that provide electricity to the car. To be useful to you or me, a car should be able to drive at least 300 miles (483 km) before refueling, be able to refuel quickly and easily and fast enough to keep up with other traffic on the road. A petrol car meets these requirements but produces a large amount of pollutants. However, an electric car produces almost no pollution, but can only travel 80 to 161 km between charges. And the problem has been that the electric car is very slow and uncomfortable to recharge. A petrol electric car combines the benefits of the two power sources into a system that uses both gas power and electric power.

The diet has been linked to a healthier older age, lower risk of heart disease and even protection against memory loss. Education is related to a longer life.

His findings show education should be an even bigger factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to get better jobs, plan for their future and make healthier lifestyle choices. Being a hard worker does not necessarily mean that job stress will hurt you. The Longevity Study found that many hard-working people lived long lives. \"Skeptics may wonder if hardworking people really enjoy life.\" The authors write: \"We found that productive, hard-working people (even in old age) are not stressed or unhappy, but tend to be happier, healthier and more socially connected than their less productive peers.\" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life.

The child does not fill in their college applications! If you are afraid that you have let your children watch too much TV and settle for low grades, you will have to face the consequences. Many parents' over-involvement in the process is, from my perspective, a cover for this deep parental anxiety: Did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I needed to do for this child? Will this child have a good life? I have seen foster parents dive back into their children's lives when admitted to college and try to fill all their wisdom and discipline in their children at the last minute. When their children leave the nest, parents may need to be sure that they have really taught them how to fly. Since it is impossible to assess the quality of what parents have done for their children at this time, it is the second best status of the college to which the child is admitted. From the point of view of a worried parent, an \"Ivy l, eague college\" child is proof of better parenting than a \"small college\" child. I once sat with a talented, weak older girl and her brilliant parents. She, they and the school had to decide whether to continue school or go to a hospital. In light of her anorexia (), the school strongly recommended that she not submit her early application to Princeton. When the girl heard this, the girl looked at the adults in the room and said, \"If I can not apply to Princeton early, I will die.\" Her parents were also eager to get her into Princeton. Why did they all need this so desperately? Because in this case, there was something wrong with the family. Due to a certain weakness in her upbringing, this child was not happy or confident. Still she was eighteen, the culture required her to leave home. The psychological solution for all of them was the comforting vision of one great college . Going there in any way would make her life good and defend her parents' parenting. Such fears of letting go of a rude child are present in all families. How can we let go of a child who is still so young in so many ways? It is painful and has no cure other than time and hope.

My wife and I wanted to give James the best education, but that meant we had to change our jobs and spend less time with our child. I asked myself, \"Would this trade-off be worth it?\" When I look at research on children's development, I think it may not be. Where our children go to school may be less important than most American parents think. Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children grow up to be successful. In a study from 2001, Greg Duncan , a professor of education at the University of California, measured the impact people have on a child's life on how well the child is doing in school. Duncan and his team found almost no connection between how the students did on the test and who they sat next to in class, who they hung out with after school and who lived in their neighborhood. The only meaningful link they found was between siblings and twins in particular. For a long time, researchers believed that a family's income greatly affected how well the children did in life. But that may not have been the case. When Susan Mayer at the University of Chicago looked at the relationship between family income and life performance, she conducted a series of experiments to measure it, finding such results was not caused by income. She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively cheap: the number of books a child has or how often his family goes to museums. Lareau, another researcher, began one of the most in-depth observations of American parenting. He concluded that success is much more related to how much time parents spend with their children. He said: \"Many parents I interviewed are worried about their children's future. But they have exaggerated the sense of risk if they do not give their children the 'best' of everything.\" So in the end, we decided to leave things as they were.

At the end of the year, the study leaders compared the students' performance with the grades. Despite their true abilities, there was an astonishingly high link between performance and grades. It seems that people are performing as well as we expect. The Self-fulfilling Effect is also known as the Pygmalion effect. This comes from an ancient Greek story. The story also formed the basis of George Bernard Shaw's play \"Pygmalion\", which was later transformed into the musical \"My Fair Lady\". In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims that he can turn a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a duchess. But, as Eliza herself points out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it is not what she learns or does that determines whether she will become a duchess, but how she will be treated. The implication of the Pygmalion effect on leaders and executives is enormous. This means that your team's performance depends less on them than on you. The performance you get from people is neither more nor less than what you expect, which means you must always expect the best. As Goethe said, \"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is.

Since we can not see what we can not see, our lecturer was determined to catch us in the act. He let us watch a video where six people threw basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to just keep track of the throws among the people in white. The band rolled and everyone started counting. Everyone except me. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw the band with the confusing basketballs, I knew I could not keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. However, I became curious when about 30 seconds into the band, a gorilla came in among the players. She (we later learned that a female student was in the gorilla costume) stared at the camera, slapped her chest with her fist and then walked away while they continued to send the balls. When the band stopped, the professor asked how many had counted on at least a dozen basketball throws. Hands went up everywhere. He then asked who had counted 13, 14 and congratulated those who had done the perfect thing 15 . Then he asked, \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover that I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the great room who did. He had set us up and caught us in our own attention blindness. Yes, it would have been a trick, but he was not the one who played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is the brain's basic organizing principle, and I think it gives us a great opportunity. My view differs from many neuroscientists: where they see the individual's shortcomings, I feel an opportunity for collaboration. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control our various forms of attention and take advantage of them.

At this stage, we will run services that stop at all stations. which will depart at the same time of the hour, but this depends on the weather conditions and the availability of train staff. \" Mr Scurrah encouraged all customers to visit the Translink website for specific departure times for their station, and asked for patience in case of delays. \"Queensland Rail recognizes that reduced services can cause disruption but it is simply inevitable. We have a dedicated and experienced team that monitors the situation around the clock and will work to resume the network as soon as practicable,\" said Scurrah.

If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ballpoint pen manufacturer - BIC. One argument is made that Goldman Sachs' famous marketing unit, the BRICs, really should be the BICs. \"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \"The Russian Balance Sheet\", thinks that Putin's and Medvedev's Russia is not worth including together with Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic power packages. He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one has to ask whether it has anything to say at all in the global economy, compared to the other members of its group. I have just returned home from Moscow, \"It's always sad this season. In the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas.\" Financially, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow by 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There are smaller cases for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still much better than Russia. But BRIC is not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing tool to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it can be argued that Russia leads the BRIC. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while about 80 percent is for the other three. At least, despite Russia's economic underperformance, its overperformance in the stock market suggests that it really is one of the group.", "qas": [{"question": "According to the passage, which country will enjoy the biggest increase in 2009?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 576, "text": "China"}], "id": "7a13950a8cec4603aac9085f2f0b9f910sv"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Vans, Keds, Dollies - they sound like the names of rock bands, but if you have teenagers, you know that they are actually the latest in teenage shoes. But experts now warn that the current shoe fashion will cause teenagers discomfort in the short term and store up years of foot, knee and back pain in the future. Here, the experts identify the problems caused by teenagers' choice of shoes. KEDS / VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are especially popular among teenage boys - with Keds and Vans the most coveted brands. The main problem is that they are simply too flat - so flat that the heel, which hits the ground first, also becomes damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are such light and thin doll shoes. The problem is partly their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. But ballet pumps, which have no string or heel, have other specific problems. \"Because the shoe has no fastening device, it relies on the toes to hold the shoe, which causes a difficult gait, leading to short- and long-term problems such as calluses, heel and knee pain.\" Wedges and stilettos These shoes can also cause problems with walking. They can look good, but the heels of these are so high that they can force the wearer's body weight, which makes them very unstable. Teenagers who wear these shoes regularly are also at risk of joining the millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday use? Something in a natural fabric that breathes, with a string to hold, with a small heel and a deep toe box that does not press the toes, like Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino.

We go to school because we want to know more about the world around us. The typical classroom used to be the place where teachers and students worked and explored the wonderful world of knowledge together, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one of these approaches. Learning via the Internet is a new style that seems to be more successful than traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a large amount of teaching materials that are available to students online. Due to the choice of courses online, it becomes much easier to complete a program. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spent hours looking for the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available around the clock. From my personal experience, as a first-time mother, I find it very helpful to use information online. While I am at home with my baby, I can still search for the materials I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my house. The Internet is not only a great information provider but also a money and time saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future due to Internet access to information. The costs of land, buildings and salaries for teachers are constantly increasing. In addition, regular courses (offline) are highly dependent on books and other paper-based material, while online education uploads lectures and assignments electronically, saving thousands of dollars each year. Without physical restrictions, the internet classes and courses are also very convenient. In classroom-based teaching, there is a limit to the number of students while internet teaching is available to everyone. Students do not have to struggle to sign up for classes they like.

Then I was asked to take me to a small plane that had just stopped slowly on the runway. Once on the plane, it soon climbed. I started to feel nervous.
