The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Lise that she was waiting for her, even though her eyes are blocked by cataracts. Lise accompanies Emily to her richly furnished home in New Orleans. Lise is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she can. Meanwhile at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe is performing an autopsy on Joe the plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs and goes to lunch, while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine starts pulsing with activity. Shortly thereafter, Joe's wife, Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi), arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for her funeral, when she is killed horribly by burns from the 'acid. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Lise meets John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss his fears and her anxieties. She expresses perplexity when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims he has never heard of her before despite the fact that he knew everyone in the area. Then comes a phone call from Harris's bar informing John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner scared and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears to Liza again that night at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the sorcerer Schweik, that she stayed in room 36 of the hotel and the supernatural underworld the hotel hides. The hotel was built on one of the Seven Gates of Hell and Schweik was the Guardian. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander across a canvas depicting a desolate vision of lost souls in a terrible, barren landscape. Suddenly scared, Emily says the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel lounge into the night. But Lise notices a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily did not step on the bare wooden planks as she ran, nor did her dog that she saw. The next day, Lise nervously ventures into room 36, a dreary ghost of covered sheets-furniture and rays of dusty light.
