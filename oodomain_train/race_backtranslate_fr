It also determines whether the camera can electronically put the details it captures large enough to see, making the images not clear enough to see when you view the photos on a larger screen. Portability \"The important thing is that the camera isn't too big or too heavy and that you have a good zoom range for both wide-angle and telephoto shots,\" Atherton told CNN. A good choice would be a thin and light pocket camera. with a highly qualified integrated optical zoom. \"These are very popular for travel because they're lightweight, but built with a telephoto lens that can zoom in up to 60x,\" Atherton said.

Gray wolves are their ancestors. Scientists are pretty consistent on this.

Boyko of Cornell University, and an international group of other scientists, have studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or village dogs. Dr Shannon analyzed three different types of DNA, Dr Boyko said, the first time it had been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin for dogs in the same way that genetic studies have traced the origin of modern humans to East Africa. The analysis, Dr Boyko said, pointed to Central Asia as where \"all the dogs alive today come from\". The data could not accurately date the origin, he said, but showed it occurred at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson from the University of Oxford, which is leading a large international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \"It's really great to see not only the number of street dogs, but also the geographic spread and the number of remote locations where the dogs have been sampled,\" he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different types of DNA and analytical methods. Dr Larson, who was not involved in the study, said he believed the discovery in Central Asia required further testing.

These include color images1 such as a corpse or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear. Congress has called for color images1 showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada Is. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate their constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights. Judge Leon said the FDA could not demand the new labels before a lawsuit against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he thought the cigarette companies had a good chance of winning their case. He said the images should be designed to appeal to the emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an \"obvious anti-smoking agenda?\" The leader of an anti-tobacco group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision \"ill-founded in science and ill-founded in law\". About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says that tobacco kills nearly six million people worldwide each year. Over six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who inhale other people's tobacco smoke.

Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and returned it to the lower house to approve minor amendments.

The interior of the earth is relatively close, but how do you get there? The deepest oil well penetrates just six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deep). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but hit bottom at around 7.5 miles below the surface. Project Mohole, an American plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the project involved government support. It becomes more and more difficult to drill deep into the earth as the rocks become softer and softer. Hard but easily breakable at the surface, the rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the crust covering it --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes drilling impossible. What little we know about the Earth's interior (like that there is a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as earthquake analysis. So maybe it's time for a new, in-depth way to explore the Earth's interior. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a fissure about half a mile long, a yard wide, and half a mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Then he would pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at around 16 feet per second, taking the robot with it and tearing the fissure deeper and deeper. The iron mass would fall for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the Earth's core, with the robot sending data to the surface. Stevenson likens his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we've never been,\" he says. \"In all possibilities, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked Isn't Going To Happen. The robot should survive temperatures that would melt just about anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a fresh look at an old problem.

Well, in response to these people, there's been a lot of research on what happens to someone's feelings when they're asked to wear a single color1 of clothing. It has been proven that if we wear clothes of particular colors, they can change our feelings. Suppose we feel sad, if we wear black, we might start to feel worse. However, if we wear green, red or yellow, we can start to feel better. It is said that each color1 has its own healing power.

So next academic year, semester 1 will be as always: sentences to paragraphing . And term 2 will work towards the 5 paragraph essay. The last 3 weeks of Term 2 will be set aside to introduce writing for the TOEFL and CEE. By then, if the students have done their work correctly, they should be able to write reasonably well. As for the Latin course, I will be posting announcements on campus next week so students understand what is on offer before I actually introduce the course. A number of students have already emailed me about the course. I am sure you do not understand how important the opening of this program in our school is. People all over the world are interested in what we plan to do. Many rewards are offered to students who successfully complete the course. Please share what I said with the administration. I want them to understand the importance of this course. The reason I contacted these colleagues (in fact Oxford contacted me) is that I have confidence in our students and in myself.

Going to a bar with friends is always enjoyable in a slightly different way. However, on the other hand, a table can also sometimes give us a lot of positive experiences.

I like to stay outside, especially eat outside. I had been aiming to eat out as often as possible this summer, so one of my first purchases for the new house was a table and set of chairs for the yard. Is my garden table a thing or an experience? It's clearly a thing and yet it allows for the experience of eating out. I love to eat outside, so my garden table is one of my favorite purchases. Therefore, I find the dividing line between things and experiences to be more nuanced than at first glance. However, to be happy, the most important thing is the type of purchases you have made. Sometimes we can all have purchases that seem like a waste of money, like probably half the clothes in our closets, but how does that happen? There are several reasons why this happens. The most important thing is that we spend a lot of time working to earn money to buy things. The problem is that we buy a lot of things that we don't really need. There's nothing worse than looking in your closet and realizing how many hours you've spent buying things you never wear. But how about a table that lets you enjoy the outdoors in summer?

The problem is so serious that urgent action is needed, warns the study, conducted by British and Chinese researchers. The survey interviewed 2,191 students aged 9 to 12 in nine schools in urban and rural Zhejiang, a very prosperous coastal province in eastern China. Eighty-one percent of young people said they worried \"a lot\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had been physically harassed at least sometimes - with boys being more more likely to be victimized than girls - and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained of having difficulty coping with the amount of homework assigned to them. More than a third reported headaches or abdominal pain - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported an incidence of aches or pains four times a week. The survey, conducted by Therese Hesketh, professor at the Center for Health and International Development at University College London (UCL), pointed to the extreme competitiveness of the Chinese education system, from the start of primary school . The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms, explain the authors. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be introduced as a matter of urgency.\" The article appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The urban setting of the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the rural setting was a poor county in Quzhou prefecture, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that it believes explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatic increase in prosperity, which has created \"unprecedented opportunities for upward mobility\" and in turn fueled pressures on children to do well in school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience and discipline. The aspirations of many parents, who themselves had limited educational opportunities, are now invested in their only children, he says. Previous studies on school stress and its impact on health are few and generally come from Scandinavia. A 2008 assessment of children aged 10-13 in Sweden found that 21% of boys out of 30% of girls suffered from headaches, and 17% of boys and 28% of girls suffered from abdominal pain in the less once a week.", "qas": [{"question": "What mainly caused schoolchildren to suffer from psychological ill-health?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 101, "text": "classroom stress and parental pressure"}], "id": "2b5bd91c586b406e9a3b3ae74a7376080fr"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "According to a survey published Thursday by the Nielson company, China has become a global tourist attraction after the Beijing Olympics.

Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor recently received top prize at the Australian Design Awards. The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four energy sources for its power  solar, wind, battery with stored solar power, and an in-store fuel generator, all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots using wind and solar power alone. These are solar wings and fiberglass solar panels that not only capture sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. We orient our solar panels towards the sun in two planes, which increases the amount of energy we receive from the sun by 40%, Dane explains. \"And we can also use this same structure to do another job, which is also sailing, and so these fin sails push the ferry forward, just like a soft sail does.\" Computers check the sun and wind and orient the solar wings to absorb as much light as possible. If there is not much wind or if the day is cloudy, the energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. If the batteries run too low, the computer turns on the generator so the boat is still able to keep a commercial schedule or get from point A to point B no matter what, says Dan. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book about insects. He was amazed to see how insects use their wings to collect solar energy for warmth.

The modern Brazilian carnival dates back to Rio de Janeiro in 1641. It originally copied the European form of the festival, later incorporating elements from Native American and African cultures.

Today they are known as blocks, made up of a group of people who dress up in special costumes or T-shirts with themes or logos. Blocks are usually connected to particular neighborhoods; they include both a live band and plenty of revelers. Block parades have become an expressive feature of Rio Carnival. Today there are more than 100 and the groups are increasing every year. Blocks can be formed by small or large groups of partygoers with a clear title.

But how do you protect a child from a big fast-food advertisement painted on her school locker? Or a toy ad on the side of his school bus? As school budgets shrink, an increasing number of schools in the United States are selling advertising space in lockers and buses, as well as in gymnasiums or cafeterias. It's an easy way for schools to earn money. And the ads can provide relief to exhausted parents by making cash donations to support schools. Although parents can always turn off televisions or computers, they cannot prevent advertising from entering schools. This is not the first time the problem has arisen. For example, a teen news program was criticized for including commercials in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts. And groups of parents have successfully fought a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and advertisements on school buses. But now things are different. Last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow businesses to advertise in district schools. Officials say the plan could provide up to $18 million for schools. In St. Francis, Minnesota, schools recently agreed to cover 10-15% of their lockers with ads. Time says. Edward Saxton, a teacher at the school, says: So far the parents have accepted this as a means of bringing in the necessary money. The money pays for programs like arts, sports and music. Parents don't like to see programs get cut. Neither do I. In addition, schools think all the time about the effects on children. However, Susan Linn, an education expert, says, Children have already seen enough ads on TV, in magazines and in the products they use every day.

The hot volcano heats the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between the glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As water flows under the glacier, the pressure increases.

But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that could be a daunting prospect. \"I have to admit I was completely frustrated with the blockage and for 18-19 miles I was just keeping away from people and being held back,\" grumbled one participant after the 2012 London Marathon. I had to pass a lot of people and I ended up with bruised forearms at all elbows,\" says another. How do these overcrowding problems arise and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which traffic jams appear - the flow of road traffic. Martin Treiber of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany has already developed traffic flow models. One of the first attempts to model traffic flows was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of the University of Manchester. They viewed traffic as a kind of liquid flowing through a pipe and observed how the flow changes as the fluid becomes denser. At first, throughput increases as density increases, because you're just passing more stuff through in the same amount of time. But if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of jamming, and the flow drops suddenly. Treiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that flow first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, through a sudden shift from free flow to congested flow. It assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With these factors alone, Treiber can calculate the throughput of runners, knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the course. This allows Treiber to understand how blocking can depend on race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons begin by letting all runners go at once (i.e., those behind must wait until those ahead have advanced). Others divide riders into different groups based on their abilities and let them start with a series of waves. Treiber applied the model to the annual Rennsteig Half Marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, as the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure runners could cross safely. It could pass either through a 60 m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blockage caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge had to be used. Only by moving the starting point farther from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the figures assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk. blockage at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the route of the tunnel. The race organizers consulted with the Treiber team and ultimately chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2937, "text": "dangerous blocking"}], "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e720fr"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on earnings and appearances in magazines, newspapers, TV shows and online.

When given codeine, they only needed slightly higher doses of capsaicin to induce a cough compared to the placebo.

Sounds amazing, doesn't it? Not if the architect is Bryan Berg, 31. He has made a career out of building fantasy card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles and the tallest card tower in the world. How is it? Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced and self-contained playing cards. He never uses glue, tape or anything else to hold the cards together. He also does not fold the cards. He discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells with resistant walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems retain their shape. Bees use the same type of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using maps to create a repeating pattern of cells. It starts with a single cell made by balancing four cards against each other to form a box. Then it repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which provides a good foundation for a solid map structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can support. Sometimes Bryan uses multiple cards, instead of just one, to build the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells children when speaking in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly as possible when setting up your grid, making sure the cards don't tilt at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards on top to make the floor for the next \"story\" of the building. He can add towers, columns, steeples or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of incredible strength. In Maps Unsurprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big, old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \"We were in the middle of nowhere,\" Bryan recalls, \"with plenty of room to do whatever we wanted. I was always doing something, using things like sticks or bales of hay.\" Bryan's grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan's two interests - building and card stacking - soon came together. But stacking up on his family's farm was a challenge. \"Our old house had wood floors that weren't all level,\" he reports. \"And they weren't very firm. When people were walking around, it was like 'an earthquake.' It was a challenge to build something that wouldn't immediately fall over.\" Bryan built round after round; he went through a lot of trial and error before building something bigger than himself. When he placed a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how sturdy it was. Bryan's towers began to grow. How big is too big? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world tallest card tower happened in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Hearing that the world record was 12ft 10in, Bryan built a slim tower that peaked at 14ft 6in. Made as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then, he has won world records for even taller buildings. His last winner was 25 feet 3.5 inches tall and used about 2,400 decks of cards. _ Why don't these towers collapse? The key is a good solid base, a repeating story pattern and a tapered top. Bryan likes to point out how the card buildings look like the real thing. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts form a solid whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can't all be at the top. After spending so much time building something this cool, Bryan admits it's sometimes painful to see his structures destroyed. But he compares his work to building a sandcastle or an ice sculpture.", "qas": [{"question": "What was Bryan's first world record?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2742, "text": "tallest card tower"}], "id": "2cd451e43d8a4324a58402fe091140170fr"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Research suggests that although most students at UK universities are happy with their courses, dissatisfaction has increased as fees rise.

The discovery should allay fears that such laws could have the opposite effect, as they could encourage people to smoke more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places in recent years. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of US states have complete bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer countries. Opponents often argue that the bans could encourage people to smoke more at home, which would be worse for the health of their children. Asthma is a top concern, as second-hand smoke damages children's airways in a number of ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been of Maastricht University Medical Center reviewed up to 11 studies that looked at how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and premature births changed after the smoking ban came into force . The studies covered more than 2.5 million births and nearly 250,000 hospital admissions for asthma. . The result shows that asthma admissions and preterm birth rates fell by about 10% in one year after smoking restrictions were put in place. The effect on premature births could also have been caused by the fact that pregnant women are more likely to quit smoking or reduce their consumption following a public ban, Been says. But Been also says studies have not been able to fully prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. However, in fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, and most saw health improvements. Such findings are useful for countries and states where there is an ongoing debate about the severity of smoking bans, especially since hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This is perhaps one of the most important things to know to strengthen the legislation.

The law, due to be voted on this month, risks revolutionizing family affairs in a country where 40 % of men would do no housework at all. It will require men to \"share domestic responsibilities as well as care and attention\" for children and elderly family members, according to the draft approved by the justice committee of the Spanish parliament. \"It will be a good way to remind people of their duties. It's something feminists have wanted for a long time,\" said Margarita Uria, of the Basque Nationalist Party, behind an amendment to a new law. on divorce. . Non-compliance with obligations will be taken into consideration by judges when determining the terms of divorces. Men who refuse to do their part may have less frequent contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times more time on household chores than husbands. Even when both have jobs outside the home, Spanish women still do three times as much work at home. \"It's not just about housework,\" Ms Uria said. A study five years ago by the Spanish Center for Sociological Investigation concluded that fathers spend an average of 13 minutes a day caring for their children. Only 19% of Spanish men thought it was right for mothers of school-age children to have a full-time job. More than a third think mothers shouldn't work outside the home at all. The change to the Spanish legal code will see domestic obligations added to a list of marital duties which currently includes fidelity, cohabitation and mutual aid.

That's the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees to deal with an active shooter situation in the workplace. The program works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset released earlier this year. An active shooter situation occurs when one or more armed persons actively shoot into a small populated area with the intent to kill. There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year saw the deadliest active shooter situation in US history, with 49 people killed in an Orlando nightclub. In the training situation, users have four choices. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, maybe in the office closet. They can run for an outing. Or they can use something in the office - a computer or a cup, a pair of scissors - as a weapon to fight off the shooter. This is an improvement over the standard active shooter training. says Gallo, who usually teaches people to lock themselves up and hide. The \"lock\" method is often ineffective , he says, and has led to many deaths in recent years. At the base level of training, no one is killed. But as practices get more advanced, players who make the wrong choice get shot. There is no blood; the screen just goes black slowly. If that sounds terrifying, that's the point, says Gallo. There are many training programs to teach employees how to deal with workplace violence, sometimes involving role-playing with toy guns. But these formations are essentially games. said Gallo, with employees relaxed and even having fun.

In addition to anti-aging and heart-healthy benefits, dark chocolate may also lower blood pressure and reduce bad cholesterol by up to 10%. Lowering blood pressure in patients with high blood level is good as it will reduce the chances of stroke and some health crises.

Most hybrid cars on the road right now are gasoline-electric hybrids. The gasoline-electric hybrid car is exactly what it sounds like: a cross between a gasoline car and an electric car. A gasoline car has a fuel tank that supplies gasoline to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that supplies the car with electricity. To be useful to you or me, a car must be able to travel at least 300 miles (483 km) before refueling, be able to be refueled quickly and easily, and fast enough to keep up with other traffic on the road. A gasoline-powered car meets these requirements but produces a large amount of pollution. An electric car, however, produces almost no pollution, but can only travel 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) between charges. And the problem is that the electric car is very slow and inconvenient to charge. A gasoline-electric car combines the benefits of both energy sources into a single system that uses both gas and electric power.

The diet has been linked to healthier old age, a lower risk of heart disease and even protection against memory loss. Education is linked to a longer life.

James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, is also a proponent of the argument for more education for better life expectancy. His findings show education should be an even bigger factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to get better jobs, plan for their future and make healthier lifestyle choices. Being a hard worker does not necessarily mean that stress at work will harm you. The longevity study found that many hard workers lived long. \"Skeptics may wonder if hard workers really enjoy life.\" The authors write, We found that productive, hard-working people (even older people) are not stressed or miserable, but tend to be happier, healthier, and more socially connected than their less productive peers. Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life. We often look to our friends and family for support, and taking care of the people who matter to us can help us take better care of ourselves, according to some evidence. Some research even suggests that immune function is enhanced when we are around friends and they help manage stress.

The college admissions process. If you're worried about not disciplining your kids enough, the evidence of parenting failure is right there in front of everyone. The child does not complete his applications for admission to the university! If you're worried about letting your kids watch too much TV and settle for low grades, you'll have to answer for the consequences. The over-involvement of many parents in the process is, in my view, a cover for this deep parental anxiety: did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I had to do for this child? Will this child live well? I have seen many parents plunge back into their children's lives at the time of college admission, trying to inject all their wisdom and discipline into their children at the last moment. Parents may need to be sure that their children leave the nest that they really taught them to fly. Since it is impossible to assess the quality of what the parents have done for their children at this stage, the best thing to do is the status of the college to which the child is admitted. From an anxious parent's perspective, an \"Ivy League\" child is evidence of better parenting than a \"little college\" child. Once I sat down with a talented, weak elderly girl and her brilliant parents. She, they and the school had to decide whether she should stay in school or go to the hospital. In light of her anorexia ( ), the school strongly recommended that she not submit her early application to Princeton. Hearing this, the girl looked at the adults in the room and said, \"If I can't apply to Princeton early, I'll die.\" Her parents were also eager to get her into Princeton. Why did they all need this so desperately? Because, in this case, something was wrong in the family. Due to a certain weakness in her upbringing, this child was neither happy nor sure of herself. However, she was eighteen years old, the culture forced her to leave the house. The psychological solution for all of them was the comforting sight of a great college .

A professor who conducts research at medical school was talking about attention blindness, the fundamental characteristic of the human brain that when we focus on one task, we miss just about everything else. Because we can't see what we can't see, our speaker was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people throwing basketballs at each other, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to follow only the throws among the people in white. The tape rolled around and everyone started counting. Everyone, except me. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw that tape with the confusing basketball pitchers, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep track of their moves, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, however, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla entered among the players. She (we later learned a student was wearing the gorilla costume) looked at the camera, punched her chest with her fist, then walked away as they continued to pass the bullets to each other. When the tape stopped, the teacher asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball throws. Hands went up everywhere. He then asked who counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who got the perfect score. 15 . Then he asked: \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to find that I was the only person at my table and one of three or four people in the large room doing so. He had trapped us, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but it wasn't him who had played it on us. Focusing so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe it offers us a great opportunity. My point of view is different from that of many neuroscientists: where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control and take advantage of our different forms of attention. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learned about being mindful means we've missed everything else. It's not easy for us logical, intelligent, confident types to admit that the very key to our success - our ability to discover a problem and solve it, an achievement achieved over all those years in school and beyond - may be exactly what limits us.

BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are light and thin doll shoes. Part of the problem is their flatness, like Keds and Vans. However, ballerinas, which have neither cord nor heel, have other specific problems. \"As the shoe does not have a binding device, it relies on the toes to hold the shoe, causing an awkward gait, which leads to short and long term problems such as calluses, heel pain and knee.\" WEDGES AND STILETTOS These shoes can also cause gait problems. They may look beautiful, but the heels of these are so high that they can force the weight of the wearer's body forward, making them very unstable. Teenage girls who regularly wear these shoes are also at risk of joining those millions of women who suffer from constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday wear? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a string to hold it in place, with a small heel and a deep toe that doesn't press on the toes, like Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing \"bad\" shoes, get them simple foot orthotics in the shoes. These support and correct the movement of the foot and, properly fitted by a podiatrist, can often transform their gait and halt the damage.", "qas": [{"question": "Of all the shoes mentioned in the passage, which can cause the worst problems?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 654, "text": "BALLET PUMPS"}], "id": "3c060f8f033345a8a16d31b89fa63d500fr"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Education plays a very important role in everyone's life. We go to school because we want to know more about the world around us. The typical classroom was once where teachers and students worked together and explored the wonderful world of knowledge, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one such approach. Learning via the Internet is a new style that seems to be more successful than traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a large amount of learning material that students can access online. With online course choices, completing a program becomes much easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spend hours looking for the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience as a first-time mother, I find using online information very helpful. While I'm home with my baby, I can still pick up the materials I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my house. The Internet is not only a big information provider, but also a time and money saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future due to access to information through the internet. The cost of land, buildings and teachers' salaries continues to rise. Additionally, regular (offline) courses rely heavily on books and other paper-based media, whereas online education publishes lectures and assignments electronically, saving thousands of dollars every year. Without any physical restrictions, classes and courses on the Internet are also very convenient. In classroom education, the number of students is limited, while Internet education is accessible to everyone. Students don't have to struggle to enroll in the classes they love. Students will have more choices to take their courses and classes online. The Internet offers a wonderful opportunity to acquire knowledge in a more practical and less expensive way.
