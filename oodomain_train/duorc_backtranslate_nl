Meanwhile, Dr. John McCabe performs an autopsy on Joe the plumber at the hospital morgue, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) plans to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs it off and goes for lunch, while Harris stays behind to set up the EMG machine. After Harris leaves to call, the EMG machine begins to pulse with activity. Moments later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for burial, when she is horribly killed by being burned with acid. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated cadaver. Liza meets John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss her doubts and concerns. He expresses his surprise when Lisa complains about the incompetence of her weird servants. John claims to have never heard of them despite knowing everyone in the area. Then comes a call from Harris's bar informing John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner, frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily reappears to Liza at the hotel that evening. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in room 36 of the hotel, and about the supernatural underworld that hides the hotel. The hotel is built over one of the seven gates of hell and Schweik has been the guard. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander to a canvas depicting a desolate vision of lost souls in a terrible and barren landscape. Emily is suddenly frightened and says that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel room into the night. But Liza notices a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily didn't step on the bare wooden planks as she ran, and neither did her guide dog. The next day, Liza nervously ventures into Room 36, a dingy ghost of sheet-covered furniture and shafts of dusty light.

Gramps refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to commit Gramps while Pud is delivered to Demetria's custody. With the help of his housekeeper (Una Merkel), Gramps makes them both believe that they will go with Mr. Brink when he comes out of the tree. They beg Grandpa to convince Brink otherwise, and Demetria swears never to bother Grandpa or Pud again.\nGrandpa realizes that sooner or later he will have to disappoint Brinks - death is an inevitable part of life after all. He tries to say goodbye to Pud, who reacts angrily and tries to run away. Mr. Brink spots Pud in the yard and challenges him to climb the tree. Pud steps over the fence Grandpa had built around the tree, but falls and is crippled for life. Distraught, Gramps lets Death fall from the tree. He takes both Grandpa and Pud, who notice that they can walk again.

Its abilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, two engines delivering 50,000 pounds of thrust each, battle ceiling over 100,000 feet, speed over Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to sustain it, no small feat), and a weapon and defense system able to read the pilot's mind and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even pressing a button, giving him a 3 to 5 second reaction time advantage on each opponent. NATO's decision is to send Gant to steal a Firefox prototype near the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant hates the operation because he is simply being blackmailed; he has been granted permission to live on government land which will now be sold under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force Attach (Thomas Hill) also hates it, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse, is subject to post-traumatic stress disorder and could burst at any moment. They only use Gant for two reasons: he speaks fluent Russian and fits perfectly with the pressure suit worn by the main test pilot of the MiG-31, Lieutenant Colonel Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff). retraining, both in flying and in dogfights, and briefings on his first required impersonation - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, who is known to smuggle heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over, he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he is disguised with a new haircut and a fake mustache. Gant is also familiar with the underground network group, who are mainly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his escorts don't tell him, though, is that if something jeopardizes the mission, Gant will be left to fend for himself. --with the \"radio\". He takes a taxi to his rooms in the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio in his pocket and waits. Outside, he sees three Soviet soldiers stepping into formation as they patrol. Meanwhile, at the KGB Center in Moscow on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB completes his plans to protect the MiG-31 ahead of its trials the following day to be held before the First Secretary of the Soviet -Union. He also orders his second-in-command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some of the underground members at dawn, but not move before. In fact, Kontarsky knows all about the spy network that is funneling Bilyarsk information out of Russia, but even he doesn't know what the CIA and SIS are really up to. That night, Gant walks to Krasnokholmskiy Bridge, ordered to be there at exactly 10:30 am with the KGB shadowing him -- he is ordered", "qas": [{"question": "Who barely reaches the Arctic ice?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 878, "text": "Gant"}], "id": "287e34da316744ffaf0973177cc0b27e0nl"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "During a short trip back to London, serious bookmarking bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is blinded by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a lively and vain London socialite.

Some convicts are sent to the battlefield with pre-designed actions to do, and will be released if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (making their death rate extremely high).

He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game, but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to check someone else, or you can get paid to be checked. Society soon became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago, Castle created Slayers, a controversial game supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that every single character in the game, although they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of serving their jail terms. If a convict can survive thirty battles, they are released (although no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent to the battlefield with pre-designed actions to do, and will be released if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (making their death rate extremely high). The games are also all broadcast on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nanocells implanted in their brains, allowing them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning they regain control after the game is over). After the show is over, the signal is hacked by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that we will all eventually be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to figure out where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape, but ultimately fails. Kable sits alone and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He tells how Kable scares everyone when he is alone and constantly thinking. He can't believe that Kable only has three fights left. Freek asks him why he is in jail. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later, sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot in the door and gives Kable a photo of his wife and child. The woman's voice on the other side knows that his family is all he's fighting for. She has Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the signature.

Mrs. Spengler is a domineering woman, but her husband seems content to rule like a child. As they wait on the tarmac near the plane, a car pulls up and a well-dressed man emerges with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is sent off with \"Uncle\" Pete until his father - a mobster - can later follow. As the passengers board, Bill, the pilot, is told that they will be transporting an anarchist back to Panama, but he assures the group that nothing is wrong as the man will be held in custody during the flight.\nThe prisoner is Vasquez and is accompanied by a bounty hunter named Crimp. After Larry the flight attendant helps everyone settle in, the flight departs with its twelve souls on board. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the layover and Joe expresses interest in Alice. He goes back to the passenger compartment where the beds are made and people turn for the night - except Crimp who plans to stay up and make sure Vasquez doesn't \"go for a walk\" - thus cheating the executioner and out of $5,000 himself. . Pete tucks his young load in for the night and helps him say his prayers (something Pete isn't familiar with). Peggy comes to the cockpit to visit Bill, whose rudeness eventually makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice calls the flight attendant, Joe takes the call and plays with her. The next morning the plane arrives for a refueling stop in Mexico and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to chase Alice, assuming she is Judson's secretary. Peggy makes another attempt to warm Bill to her and is rejected again. Then Pete tells her that her help is not needed as she tries to get Tommy to drink his milk. Peggy has been \"marked\" as a riotous woman by her fellow travelers who want nothing to do with her. Before a reporter boards the plane, a reporter confronts Judson and Alice and Joe discover that she is engaged to her \"boss\" and that they are on the run. the flight continues and ends up in stormy weather. The professor discusses the methods by which a South American tribe of headhunters practice their trade. The conversation is interrupted by a news bulletin explaining how Tommy's father was murdered. Peggy tries to help Tommy again and says \"he needs a woman.\" But Pete is still judgmental and replies \"he needs a lady.\" Mrs. Spengler intervenes and comforts Tommy. As the storm they fly through gets tougher, the passengers strap into their seats and Crimp insists the pilots return. As the plane rocks back and forth, some metal cylinders break loose and crash through the back door. Tommy gets dangerously close to getting out the door when Llarry rescues him and hands him over to Pete. At that moment, the plane descends sharply and Larry is thrown out the door, to his death. While Joe and Bill try to stabilize the plane, Crimp tries to force them to turn back by waving his gun at them. In the battle, the gun goes off and is picked up by Vasquez. With a damaged engine, the Silver Queen crashes, and all eleven on board survive.
