They grab an artist named Schweik (Antoine Saint John) who is imprisoned there. Schweik accuses him of being a sorcerer and is dragged into the basement, where he is brutally beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a basement wall, despite his dire warnings of the evil to be unleashed. New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who comes from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. As soon as the architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) has started to show her the property, strange things start to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his oil rig and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and nattering \"eyes, eyes\". dr John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers his condolences to Liza. Next, a plumber named Joe tries to fix a large leak in the flooded basement. However, he is assassinated by a presence that appears from behind a narrow wall. The atmosphere at the hotel is further chilled by the creepy-looking servants Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who appear to be coming with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's body in the basement and another, much older body lying in a pond of dirty water nearby. It is evidently that of Schweik, the artist. On the 14-mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza meets a strange blind woman standing in the middle of a deserted highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza she's been waiting for her, even though her eyes are closed by cataracts. Liza drives Emily to her opulently decorated New Orleans home. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile, Dr. John McCabe performs the autopsy on Joe the plumber in the hospital morgue while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) tries to install an EMG machine on Schweik's body. John laughs at this and goes to lunch while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins to pulse with activity. A little later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to prepare her husband's body for burial when she is horribly scalded to death acid . Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets with John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss her concerns and fears. He expresses confusion when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims he's never heard of them, even though he knows everyone in the area. Then a call comes in from the bar from Harris telling John that Mary-Anne's body has been found in the morgue, while Jill has been found huddled in a corner, terrified and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily Liza appears again at the hotel that evening. Emily tells Liza about the sorcerer Schweik who lived in room 36 of the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of the seven gates of hell, and Schweik was the keeper. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander to a canvas depicting a desolate vision of lost souls in a horrible and arid landscape. Suddenly frightened, Emily says that the picture was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel salon into the night. But Liza notes a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily didn't take steps on the bare wooden boards when she ran, and neither did her guide dog.

Liza drives Emily to her opulently decorated New Orleans home. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile, Dr. John McCabe performs the autopsy on Joe the plumber in the hospital morgue while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) tries to install an EMG machine on Schweik's body. John laughs at this and goes to lunch while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins to pulse with activity. A little later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress up her husband's body for the funeral when she is horribly scalded with acid. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets with John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss her concerns and fears. He expresses confusion when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims he's never heard of them, even though he knows everyone in the area. Then a call comes in from the bar from Harris telling John that Mary-Anne's body has been found in the morgue, while Jill has been found huddled in a corner, terrified and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily Liza appears again at the hotel that evening. Emily tells Liza about the sorcerer Schweik who lived in room 36 of the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of the seven gates of hell, and Schweik was the keeper. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander to a canvas depicting a desolate vision of lost souls in a horrible and arid landscape. Suddenly frightened, Emily says that the picture was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel salon into the night. But Liza notes a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily didn't take steps on the bare wooden boards when she ran, and neither did her guide dog. The next day, Liza nervously ventures into room 36, a dingy mess of torn furniture and dusty lightwells.

Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else was able to see the stranger; he was not just a dream or an apparition.\nPud tells Gramps if he a good deed , he will be able to wish for something. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs his apple tree must stay there until he allows them to climb down. Pud accidentally tests the wish when he's having trouble getting down the tree himself, only becoming free when Gramps says he can.\nPud's busy aunt Demetria (Eily Malyon) is after Pud and the money his parents left him. Gramps spends a lot of time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy.\nBrink takes Granny Nellie (Beulah Bondi) to a peaceful death shortly after she's done some knitting. When Mr. Brink returns for Gramps again, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud to Demetria, Gramps tricks Mr. Brink into climbing the apple tree. While stuck in the tree, he cannot take Gramps or anyone else with him. The only way anyone or anything can die is if they touch Mr. Brink or the apple tree.\nDemetria plans to commit Gramps to a psychiatric hospital when he claims death is trapped in his apple tree. Gramps first proves his story by proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans (Henry Travers), can't even kill a fly they catch. He provides further proof of his power by shooting Mr. Grimes (Nat Pendleton), the orderly who came to take him to the asylum; Grimes lives when he should have died.\ndr Evans is now a believer, but he's trying to convince Gramps to abandon death so that suffering people can find redemption. Gramps refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to bring Gramps in while Pud is handed over to Demetria. With the help of his housekeeper (Una Merkel), Gramps tricks the two of them into going with Mr. Brink when he comes down from the tree. They ask Gramps to convince Brink otherwise, and Demetria vows never to bother Gramps or Pud again.\nGramps realizes that sooner or later he will have to let Brinks down - death is an ultimately inevitable part of life. He tries to say goodbye to Pud, who reacts angrily and tries to run away. Mr. Brink sees Pud in the yard and challenges him to climb the tree. Pud climbs over the fence Gramps built around the tree, but falls and is crippled for life. Distraught, Gramps lowers Death from the tree. He takes both Gramps and Pud, who find they can walk again. In the final scene, they walk up a beautiful country lane together and hear Grandma Nellie calling them from behind a brilliant light.", "qas": [{"question": "What did he have to do to get the wish?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 446, "text": "good deed"}], "id": "7a4d0d23a0fa459e9f1701cd965f22df0de"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "A Huey helicopter flies over the Alaskan wilderness, its pilots searching for someone below.

Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A-4 dropped an incendiary device onto the site, killing a little girl who stood too long watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The next scenes are back and forth cuts between the conversations Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of British SIS on the Soviet Union's newest fighter/interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" Model 31, codenamed \"Firefox\" by NATO. Its abilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, two engines with 50,000 pounds of thrust each, a combat ceiling of over 100,000 feet, a speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and being able to maintain it, no small feat) and a Armament and defense system capable of reading the pilot's mind, allowing him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, giving him a reaction time advantage of 3 to 5 seconds over any opponent . NATO's decision is to send Gant to steal a Firefox prototype directly from the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant refuses the surgery because he is being blackmailed, quite simply; he was allowed to live on state lands, which will now be sold under his rule if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force Attache (Thomas Hill) is also annoyed because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and can collapse at any time. They only use Gant for two reasons: he is fluent in Russian and fits perfectly into the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's chief test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff). Gant undergoes several weeks of retraining, both in flying and air combat, and briefings on his first required personification - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known for smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training, he is sent to London, where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his goals and he is disguised with a new haircut and fake mustache. Gant is also familiar with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also gives him a disposable homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio.

Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A-4 dropped an incendiary device onto the site, killing a little girl who stood too long watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The next scenes are back and forth cuts between the conversations Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of British SIS on the Soviet Union's newest fighter/interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" Model 31, codenamed \"Firefox\" by NATO. Its abilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, two engines with 50,000 pounds of thrust each, a combat ceiling of over 100,000 feet, a speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and being able to maintain it, no small feat) and a Armament and defense system capable of reading the pilot's mind, allowing him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, giving him a reaction time advantage of 3 to 5 seconds over any opponent . NATO's decision is to send Gant to steal a Firefox prototype directly from the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant refuses the surgery because he is being blackmailed, quite simply; he was allowed to live on state lands, which will now be sold under his rule if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force Attache (Thomas Hill) is also annoyed because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and can collapse at any time. They only use Gant for two reasons: he is fluent in Russian and fits perfectly into the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's chief test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff). Gant undergoes several weeks of retraining, both in flying and air combat, and briefings on his first required personification - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known for smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training, he is sent to London, where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his goals and he is disguised with a new haircut and fake mustache. Gant is also familiar with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also gives him a disposable homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his superiors don't tell him, however, is that if anything jeopardizes the mission--with the \"radio,\" Gant will be left to his own devices. He takes a taxi to his room in the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio in his pocket and waits. Outside, he sees three Soviet soldiers goose-stepping in formation during a patrol. Meanwhile, at the Moscow KGB Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB is completing his plans to protect the MiG-31s from their trial day being conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his deputy, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then. Kontarsky actually knows all about the spy network that is leaking information from Bilyarsk out of Russia  but even he doesn't know what the CIA and SIS are really planning. That night, Gant goes to the Krasnokholmskiy Bridge with instructions to be there at 10:30 sharp while the KGB tails him - he is ordered", "qas": [{"question": "Who barely reaches the Arctic ice?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 865, "text": "Gant"}], "id": "287e34da316744ffaf0973177cc0b27e0de"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "On a short trip back to London, serious-minded, life-changing bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is blindsided by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a feisty and vain London socialite.

He goes back into the passenger compartment, where the beds have been made and people are checking in for the night - except for Crimp, who plans to stay up and make sure Vasquez doesn't \"go for a walk\" - thus cheating the hangman and not himself $5,000. Pete puts his young charge to bed for the night and helps him say his prayers (something Pete is unfamiliar with). Peggy comes into the cockpit to visit Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice rings for the steward, Joe takes the call and plays for her. The next morning the plane arrives in Mexico for a refueling stop and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to pursue Alice, assuming she is Judson's secretary. Peggy makes another attempt to get Bill to warm to her and is rebuffed again. Then Pete tells her that her help is not needed as she tries to get Tommy to drink his milk. Peggy was \"marked\" as an easy-going woman by her fellow travelers, who want nothing to do with her. the flight continues, heading for stormy weather. The professor discusses the methods used by a South American tribe of headhunters to ply their trade. The conversation is interrupted by a news program reporting how Tommy's father was killed. Peggy tries to help Tommy again, saying \"He needs a wife.\" But Pete is still judgmental and replies \"he needs a lady.\" Mrs. Spengler steps in and comforts Tommy. As the storm they're flying through intensifies, the passengers strap themselves into their seats and Crimp insists the pilots turn back. As the plane rocks back and forth, a couple of metal cylinders detach and crash through the back door. Tommy is dangerously close to walking out the door when Llarry saves him and hands him to Pete. Just then, the plane makes a sharp dive and Larry is thrown out the door to his death. As Joe and Bill try to stabilize the plane, Crimp tries to force them to turn back by swinging his gun at them. In the fight, the gun goes off and is picked up by Vasquez. With a damaged engine, the Silver Queen crashes and all 11 on board survive.
