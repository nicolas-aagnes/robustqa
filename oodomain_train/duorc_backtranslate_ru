The artist (Anthony Fleece) falls from his setup and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and muttering, \"Eyes, eyes.\" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the wounded man to the hospital and offers Lisa some sympathy. Then a plumber named Joe tries to fix a major leak in a flooded basement. However, he is killed by a creature that appears from behind a thin plastered wall.

Martha discovers Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying nearby in a puddle of dirty water. Obviously, this belongs to the artist Schweik. Driving over a 14-mile causeway into New Orleans, Lisa encounters a strange blind woman standing in the middle of a deserted highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Lisa that she has been waiting for her even though her eyes are covered by cataracts.

With the death of the king, no one can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. When war threatens to tear the country apart, a stone and an anvil appear from the sky in the city of London, and a sword is firmly stuck into the anvil. On the hilt of the sword, read the words: \"Whoever draws this sword from this stone and anvil, he will rightfully become a king born in England.\" Many try to draw the sword, but no one can move it. Over time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the countryside into a gloomy state. One day in the woods, Sir Kay is hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls \" Wart .' After Kay misses shooting a deer, Arthur promises to return the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut inhabited by a sorcerer named Merlin and his pet owl, Archimedes, who can speak. Merlin explains to Arthur that he was expecting him to appear. After they have had tea, Merlin decides to escort Arthur back to his house, and after packing everything in the hut into a small bag, the two of them set off. Arthur and Merlin arrive at Sir Ector's castle, where Arthur is immediately sent to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector and demonstrates his powers to the doubting knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay by placing him in the Northwest Tower, the crumbling castle building. A few days later, Archimedes watches the arrival of Sir Pelinor, who brings Ector news of the jousting tournament. and Kay. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Hector eagerly begins to train Kay and in his excitement promises Arthur that if he continues to diligently fulfill his duties, he can become Kay's squire. can move into the past and the future, he knows what Arthur will become). Walking along the castle moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merlin turns them both into fish to explore the moat. However, young Arthur is soon chased by a much larger fish until they both manage to escape. Arthur's late arrival to help Kaya practice leads to him doing the dishes. Merlin finds him and, having bewitched the crockery and washing utensils, leads Arthur into the woods, where the sorcerer turns them both into squirrels. As Arthur jumps between the trees, he meets a squirrel girl who soon falls madly in love with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario endearing until another squirrel soon finds it irresistible. Merlin then returns himself and Arthur to normal. The squirrel girl, in love with Arthur, runs away heartbroken. Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector chastises Merlin for making Arthur shirk his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his \"rant\" ends with Hector declaring that Arthur will not become Kay's squire, and that the honor will belong to another man in the castle, named Hobbs. Arthur is devastated by what has happened. , but Merlin tries to make him persist and plans to train Arthur. When he tries to explain things, Archimedes interferes with Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin teaches Arthur things that won't be proven for hundreds of years and may well make people think of Arthur as an insane lunatic in their current Dark Ages.

This someone, US Air Force Major Mitchell Gant (ret.) (Clint Eastwood), hears an approaching helicopter and instantly runs back to his cabin, where he takes a shotgun from the rack and cocks the hammer. As the helicopter lands, Gant is plunged into a post-traumatic flashback of a nightmare he experienced in Vietnam: he was shot down over the North in his A-4, he was being driven to a POW camp when two Hueys machine-gunned his captors. . Gant suffered a personal injury when an overflying A-4 dropped an incendiary mixture on the site, killing a little girl who had stood by for too long watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholtz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of the episode and apologizes for the surprise. Gant and Buckholz, as well as a briefing by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS regarding the Soviet Union's latest fighter/interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG Model 31, codenamed \"Firefox\" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: complete stealth, two engines each providing 50,000 pounds of thrust, a combat ceiling at over 100,000 feet, speeds in excess of Mach 5 or even 6 (and the ability to maintain it is no mean feat), and weaponry and a defense system capable of reading the pilot's mind and allowing him to aim and fire his weapon without even pressing a button, giving him a reaction time advantage of 3 to 5 seconds over any opponent. NATO's solution is to send Gant to steal a Firefox prototype directly from a Soviet development base in Bilyarsk, near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents this operation because he is simply being blackmailed; he was allowed to live on state land, which would now be sold out of his control if he did not accept the mission. The NATO Air Force attach (Thomas Hill) is also outraged because Gant has no experience in espionage and, even worse, he is prone to post-traumatic stress disorder and can crack at any moment. They only use Gant for two reasons: he speaks fluent Russian and is perfect for the spacesuit worn by the MiG-31's chief test pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Voskov (Kai Wolf). retraining for both flying and air combat, as well as being briefed on his first demand to impersonate a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague who is known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After finishing his training, he is sent to London, where Aubrey gives him a final briefing on his goals and is disguised with a new haircut and false mustache. Gant is also familiar with an underground network group composed primarily of Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. However, his handlers do not tell him that if anything jeopardizes the mission, Gant will be left alone. Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, goes through an unannounced customs inspection, and manages to leave the airport. - with \"radio\". He takes a taxi to his room at the Moskva Hotel, puts the radio in his pocket and waits. Outside, he sees three Soviet soldiers marching in formation while on patrol.

Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will leave the game. Producer (Michael Weston) and chief of staff Bob (John de Lancie) of The Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest on the show - reclusive genius Ken Castle, creator of Slayers. In the series, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the accomplishments of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called \"Society\" which is essentially a Sims game, but instead of controlling a fake character, players control a real person and can make him do whatever they want. You may be paid to control someone else, or you may be paid to be controlled. The society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest man in the universe. Nine months ago, Castle created the controversial Slayers game, which is backed by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that all the characters in the game, although they are real people, are death row inmates who chose to sign on to the game instead of serving their prison sentences. If the convict can survive thirty battles, he will be released (although no one has survived that long yet). Some convicts are sent to pre-arranged battlefields and will be released if they survive even one battle but fail to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). In addition, all games are broadcast on pay-per-view television. Everyone in the Slayers and Society has nanocells implanted in their brains, allowing them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled around the perimeter of the game (meaning that after the end of the game they regain control). After the show ends, the signal is hacked by Humanz, a resistance group. Brother of Man (Ludacris) denounces Castle and declares that we will all become his slaves in the end if we continue on this path.

When planted, the seed grows into a flower, and inside the flower is a tiny girl the size of an old woman's thumb. The old woman calls the girl Thumbelina and brings her up as her own.\nAlthough Thumbelina loves her mother, she yearns to be with someone her size. One night, Cornelius, the fairytale prince, stumbles upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful singing. The two ride Cornelius' bumblebee and fall in love; during this trip, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are captivated by Thumbelina's singing. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he has left, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and carries her away.\nThumbelina wakes up on Mrs. Toad's show boat. Mrs. Toad wants Thumbelina to join their troupe and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Thumbelina alone on a water lily to fetch a priest, but the friendly swallow Jaquimo (the film's narrator) overhears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jakimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely, and Jakimo sets out to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's kidnapping and decides to find her.\nTrying to get back home, Thumbelina is ambushed by the Berkeley Beetle, who scares off the jitterbugs. He is entranced by her singing and promises to show her the way home if she sings to his Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she is poorly received at the Bug Ball, the Bug kicks her out without helping her.\nWinter is coming. Jaquimo accidentally pierces his wing with a thorn and passes out from the cold, while Cornelius falls into the lake and freezes in the ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with him. Prince Cornelius, and after some persuasion from the Beetle, decides to find and kidnap Cornelius in order to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel gets the Beetle to help him as Grundel steals his wings and won't get them back until the Beetle finds and captures Cornelius.\nThumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who informs her that Cornelius has died. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor Mr. Mole, who tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier that day. It turns out to be Jaquimo, whom Thumbelina only discovers unconscious. Mr Mole wants to marry Thumbelina; Heartbroken over the death of Cornelius, Thumbelina agrees. Jaquimo wakes up under Thumbelina's care and goes off in search of Cornelius, refusing to believe that he is dead. Meanwhile, the Beetle brings the frozen body of Cornelius to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the Mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young beetles thaw out Cornelius' body.\nAt the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last moment that she cannot marry someone she doesn't love and refuses to take vows. Grundel and Beetle crash the wedding, but Thumbelina runs away from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, resulting in the ensuing fight, both of them fall into the abyss.
