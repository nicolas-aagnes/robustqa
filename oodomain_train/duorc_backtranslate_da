Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her legacy. As soon as architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) starts showing her around the property, strange events begin to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls from his rig and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and blabbering on about \"the eyes, the eyes.\" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the wounded man to the hospital and gives Liza some sympathy. Next, a plumber named Joe tries to repair a major leak in the flooded basement. However, he is murdered by a presence that appeared behind a slender-cakeed wall. The atmosphere of the hotel is further cooled by the eerie-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's dead body in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a puddle of dirty water nearby. It's apparently the artist's Schweik. As Liza drives down the 14-mile dam road to New Orleans, Liza encounters a strangely blind woman standing in the middle of the deserted freeway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller), and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her even though her eyes are clogged with cataracts. Liza drives Emily over to her lavishly furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile, at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe the autopsy of plumber Joe, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) will install an EMG machine for the body of Schweik. John laughs at it and goes to lunch while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins to pulsate with activity.

As Liza drives down the 14-mile dam road to New Orleans, Liza encounters a strangely blind woman standing in the middle of the deserted freeway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller), and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her even though her eyes are clogged with cataracts. Liza drives Emily over to her lavishly furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile, at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe the autopsy of plumber Joe, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) will install an EMG machine for the body of Schweik. John laughs at it and goes to lunch while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins to pulsate with activity. A little later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to decorate her husband's body for the funeral, as she is killed in a horrific way by the scald with acid. Jill is then threatened by the revived corpse of Schweik. Liza meets with John McCabe in a bar in the center to discuss her concerns and concerns. He expresses astonishment as Lisa complains about the incompetence of her strange servants. John claims he has never heard of them before, despite knowing everyone in the area. Then comes a phone call from the bar from Harris informing John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found crouched in a corner scared and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily reappears for Liza that evening at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the wizard Schweik who lived in room 36 of the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of Hell's seven gates, and Schweik has been the guardian. Emily is about to reveal more as her hands wander over to a canvas that shows a deserted vision of lost souls in a terrible and dry landscape. Suddenly scared, Emily tells us that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel room into the night. But Liza notices a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily did not fall on the bare wooden boards while running, nor did her sighted dog. The next day, Liza nervously enters Room 36, a dingy fantasy painting of sheet-covered furniture and shafts of dusty light.

Its capabilities seem above ground: total stealth, twin engines, each delivering 50,000 pounds of propulsion, combat ceiling 100,000 feet-plus, speed of over Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat) and a weapon and defense system capable of reading the pilot's thoughts and allowing him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, giving him a 3- to 5-second reaction time advantage over any opponent.

That night, Holly goes out on the fire escape to escape an overzealous date (Mel Blanc). She looks into Paul's apartment and sees 2E leave money and kiss Paul goodbye. After 2E leaves, Holly walks into Paul's apartment and finds out that he is an author who has not had anything published since a book of vignettes five years before. Holly, in turn, explains that she tries to save money to support her brother Fred when he escapes from the army. The couple falls asleep but is awakened as Holly has a nightmare about Fred. She later buys Paul a typewriter tape to apologize and invites him to a party in her apartment. There, Paul meets his Hollywood agent, O. J. Berman (Martin Balsam), who describes Holly's transformation from country girl to Manhattan socialite. He is also introduced to Jos da Silva Pereira (Jos Luis de Vilallonga), a wealthy Brazilian politician, and Rusty Trawler (Stanley Adams), the \"ninth richest man in America under 50.\"\nIn the days that follow, Paul and Holly get closer to each other. One day, 2E enters Paul's apartment, worried that she's being followed. Paul tells her he wants to investigate and eventually confronts Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen), Holly's estranged husband.

When planted, the seed grows into a flower, and inside blossom is a little girl the size of the old woman's thumb. The old woman names the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own.\nAlthough Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for companionship from someone her own size. One night, Cornelius, the fairytale prince, falls over Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two take a ride on Cornelius' bumble bee, and fall in love; during this trip, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by Tommelise's song. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he leaves, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away.\nThumbelina wakes up on Mrs. Toad's show boat. Mrs. Toad wants Thumbelina to join their troupe and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Tommelise alone on a lily leaf to pick up a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the film's narrator), overhears Tommelise's cry for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely, while Jacquimo sets off to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius becomes aware of Tommelise's kidnapping and sets out to find her.\nWhile trying to get home, Thumbelina is attacked by Berkeley Beetle, who scares away jitterbugs. He loves her song, and promises to show her the way home if she first sings at his Beetle Ball. Thumbelina agrees, but when she is poorly received at Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her.\nWinter is approaching. Jacquimo accidentally spits his wing on a thorn and is knocked out of the cold while Cornelius falls into a lake and freezes to ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and, after some conviction from Beetle, decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him as Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius.\nThumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is dead. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Pier, which tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier in the day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, whom Thumbelina discovers is only unconscious. Sir. Mole wants to marry Thumbelina; crushed over Cornelius' death, Tommelise accepts. Jacquimo wakes up under Thumbelina and sets off to find Cornelius and refuses to believe he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius' frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is to marry the mole. After the two travel to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius' body.\nAt the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last minute that she can not marry someone she does not love, and refuses to make the vows. Grundel and Beetle crash the wedding, but Thumbelina escapes from them and Mr. Pier. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing battle results in them both falling into an abyss. When Tommelise is out and free, Tommelise is reunited with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Valley of the Fairies. Cornelius shows up, after surviving the fall, the couple reunites, and Tommelise accepts his proposal of marriage. The two kiss, and Thumbelina gets her own wings.\nWith Tommelise's mother and the ferret present, Tommelise and Cornelius get married and set off on their honeymoon on Cornelius' bumble bee.
