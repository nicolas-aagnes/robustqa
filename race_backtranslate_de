Sensor size Along with the number of megapixels, the size of the sensor determines the overall image quality as well as the camera's performance in low light. It also determines whether the camera can electronically represent the detail it captures large enough to see - resulting in the images not being clear enough to see when you view the photos on a larger screen. Portability \"What's important is that the camera isn't too big or too heavy, and that you have a good zoom range for wide-angle and telephoto shots,\" Atherton told CNN. A good choice would be a slim, lightweight pocket camera with a high quality built-in optical zoom. \"These are very popular for travel because they're lightweight but come with a telephoto lens that can zoom up to 60x,\" Atherton said.

Boyko and an international group of other scientists studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or village dogs. dr Shannon analyzed three different types of DNA, Dr. Boyko, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin for dogs, much like genetic studies have pinpointed the origin of modern humans to East Africa. The analysis, said Dr. Boyko, pointed to Central Asia as the place from which \"all dogs alive today\" originate. The data didn't allow for an exact dating of the origin, he said, but showed it occurred at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson from the University of Oxford, who is leading a major international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \"It's really great to see not only the number of street dogs, but also the latitude and the number of remote locations where the dogs have been sampled,\" he said in an email.

His music influenced singers like Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. In 1950, Muddy Waters recorded a song called \"Rolling Stone\". A British rock group is said to have named themselves after the song by Muddy Waters. The Rolling Stones performed for the first time in 1962. The members of the group called themselves \"the greatest rock and roll band in the world\". In 1965 Bob Dylan released his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\".

This includes color images1 such as a corpse or a diseased lung. And simple text alerts now appear. Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate their constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression rights. Judge Leon said the FDA cannot request the new labels until a lawsuit against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers had a high probability of winning their case. He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions and dismissed the government's arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an \"apparent anti-smoking agenda\"?

The interior of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well penetrates only six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles below). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but reached about rock bottom 7.5 miles under the surface. The Mohole Project, a US plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles deep to the boundary between the hard rock of the crust and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the project involved government support. It's getting harder and harder to drill deep into the ground because rocks are getting softer. Hard on the surface but easily fractured, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlying crust -- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles -- makes further drilling impossible. The little we know about the interior of the Earth (like the fact that there is a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence like analyzing earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a radical new way to explore the Earth's interior. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a rift. Stevenson proposes digging a crack roughly half a mile long, a meter wide, and half a mile deep (not with a shovel), but with an explosion on the order of an atomic bomb. Next, along with a robot, he would pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, was moving down at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The mass of iron would fall to the outer edge of Earth's core for about a week and 2,000 miles, with the robot sending data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we've never been,\" he says. \"In all likelihood there will be surprises.\" This idea probably fits into the drawer labeled Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt just about anything. But Stevenson's idea can inspire a new look at an old problem.

Today it remains a challenging and popular spot for rock climbers. ' * Cliffs of Etretat, France These cliffs on France's Alabaster Coast offer more than sheer walls.

The reason for this is that our choice of color1 mirrors corresponds to our feeling. Those who don't believe in the idea, the words \"if only this really worked\" can often be heard. Well, to answer these people, a lot of research has been done on what happens to a person's feelings when asked to wear only one color1 of clothing. It has been proven that wearing certain colors of clothing can change how we feel. Assuming we are sad, wearing black may make us feel worse. However, if we wear green, red or yellow, we may feel better. Each color1 is said to have its own healing power.

So next academic year, Term 1 will be as usual: sentences to paragraphing . And Term 2 will work towards the 5 paragraph essay. The last 3 weeks of Term 2 are reserved to introduce TOEFL and CEE writing. By then, if the students have done their work properly, they should be able to write fairly well. As for the Latin course, I will be putting up notices around campus next week so students understand what's on offer before I actually present the course. Some students have already emailed me about the course. I'm sure you don't understand what a big deal it is to start this program at our school. People all over the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many rewards for the students who are successful in the course. Please let management know what I said.

Going to a bar with friends is always pleasant in slightly different ways. On the other hand, a table can sometimes give us many positive experiences.

I really like to stay outside, especially I eat outside. It was my goal to eat outside as much as possible this summer, so one of my first purchases for the new house was a table and set of chairs for the garden. Is my garden table a thing or an experience? It is clearly a thing and still allows for the experience of eating outside. I love eating outside and that's why my garden table is one of my favorite purchases of all. As such, I find the dividing line between things and experiences more nuanced than meets the eye. However, to be happy, the most important thing is what kind of purchases you made. Sometimes we all have purchases that seem like a waste of money, like probably half the clothes in our closets, but how does that happen? There are many reasons why this happens. The biggest thing is that we spend a lot of our time making money to buy things. The problem is that we buy a lot of things that we don't really need.

The problem is so bad that urgent action is needed, warns the study led by British and Chinese researchers. The research surveyed 2,191 students aged nine to 12 in nine schools in urban-rural Zhejiang, a prosperous coastal province in east China. 81 percent of young people said they were \"very\" worried about exams, 63 percent feared punishment by their teacher, 44 percent had been physically bullied at least sometimes - with boys being more likely to be victims than girls - and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most children complained that they had difficulty coping with the amount of homework they were given. More than a third stated that they had a headache or stomach ache \u2013 psychosomatic stress symptoms \u2013 at least once a week. The most stressed children reported pain occurring four times a week. The research, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at University College London's (UCL) Center for International Health and Development, pointed the finger at the extreme competitiveness of the Chinese education system from the very beginning of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment results in high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" say the authors. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be initiated as a matter of urgency.\" The paper appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the \"rural\" setting was a poor county in Quzhou Prefecture in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that are said to explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatically increased prosperity, which has created \"unprecedented opportunities for advancement\" and thus increased the pressure on the children to perform at school. Other reasons include China's one-child policy and the Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, piety, obedience, and discipline. \"The hopes of many parents, who themselves had limited educational opportunities, are now being invested in their only children,\" it says. Previous studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are scarce and generally come from Scandinavia.

It uses four energy sources for its electricity - solar, wind, battery power using stored solar energy, and an in-storage fuel generator, all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel at speeds of up to 7.5 knots using only wind and solar energy. It's solar wings and fiberglass solar panels that not only capture sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \"We orient our solar panels in two planes to the sun, which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\" says Dane. \"And we can also use the same structure for another task, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry forward, just like a soft sail.\" Computers check the sun and wind and align the solar wings that way that they absorb the most sunlight. When the wind is calm or the sky is cloudy, the energy stored in the batteries drives the electric motor for up to five hours. \u201cWhen the batteries are low, the computer turns on the generator so the boat can always run on a commercial schedule or, in any event, get from point A to point B,\u201d explains Dan.

Instead, the state lives on oil and gas.\u201d Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund expects the Russian economy to contract by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow by 8.5 percent and India by 5.4 percent. Brazil is less important with a minus of 0.7 percent, but still performs significantly better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economics.

And ads can relieve parents who are exhausted by donating money to support schools. While parents can turn off the television or computers at any time, they cannot keep advertising out of schools. This is not the first time the problem has arisen. For example, a teenage news program was criticized for including commercials in its 12-minute educational programs. And parent groups successfully fought a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and advertising on school buses. But now things are different. Just last month, Los Angeles approved a plan that would allow businesses to advertise in the borough's schools. Officials say the plan could provide up to $18 million for the schools. In St. Francis, Minnesota, schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their lockers with advertising. the time says.

How do such crowding problems arise and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which congestion occurs - road traffic flow. Martin Driver from the Technical University of Dresden in Germany has previously developed traffic flow models. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of the University of Manchester in the 1950s. They viewed traffic as a type of fluid flowing through a pipe and studied how the flow changes as the fluid becomes denser. With increasing density, the flow rate increases first, since you can simply get more stuff through in the same amount of time. However, if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of congestion and the flow rate drops sharply. Driver's model of a marathon uses the same principle that flow velocity first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases thanks to a sudden change from free to crowded flow. He posits that different runners have a set of different preferred speeds that everyone maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Driver can calculate the flow rate of the runners and knows the \"load capacity\" at every point of the course. This allows the driver to find out how the blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example for different starting procedures. Some marathons start with all runners starting at once (meaning those behind have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others divide runners into different groups based on skill level and have them start in a series of waves. Driver has transferred the model to the annual Rennsteig half marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be altered in 2013 because police were no longer willing to close a road to allow runners to cross safely. It could go either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Driver used his model to predict the likely deadlock caused in the different options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk overloading runners if the bridge was used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the hazard be avoided - and even if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of congestion at the bridge. On the other hand no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted with Treiber's team and finally decided on this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2958, "text": "dangerous blocking"}], "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e72de"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on income and appearances in magazines, newspapers, TV shows and online.

Sounds incredible right? Not when the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He has made a career by building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitals, castles and the tallest card tower in the world. How does he do that? Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, free-standing playing cards. He never uses glue, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. He doesn't fold the cards either. He discovered another way to build a strong house of cards using a trick found in nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have strong walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a lattice that helps leaves and stems hold their shape. Bees use the same type of repeating pattern to create strong combs in which to live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids using maps to create a repeating pattern of cells. It begins with a single cell made up of four cards weighed against each other to form a box. It then repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid that forms a good foundation for a strong map structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can support. Sometimes Bryan uses multiple cards instead of just one to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells the kids when he speaks in the classroom, is to lay the cards as close together as possible when laying out the grid, making sure the cards aren't skewed at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays maps over it to set the ground for the building's next \"story.\" He can add towers, columns, steeples or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of amazing strength. In the Cards Unsurprisingly, Bryan has always had an interest in building things. Raised on a \"big old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \u201cWe were in the middle of nowhere,\u201d Bryan recalls, \u201cwith a lot of space to do whatever we wanted. I've always made something using things like sticks or hay bales.\u201d Bryan's grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan's two interests - building and decking - soon combined. But stacking them at his family's farmhouse was a challenge. \"Our old house had hardwood floors, and they weren't all flat,\" he says. \"And they weren't very tight. When people walked around it was like 'earthquake action'. It was a challenge to build something that wouldn't fall right away.\" Bryan built tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before building something bigger than himself. When he laid a few decks of cards on his grid , he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's towers began to get taller. How big is too big? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992 when he was in high school. Upon learning that the world record was 12ft 10\", Bryan built a slender tower 14ft 6\" tall. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then he has set world records for even taller buildings. His most recent winner was 25ft 3.5in and used about 2,400 decks. _ Why don't these towers collapse? The key lies in a good solid base, a repeating pattern of stories and a tapered top. Bryan likes to point out how map buildings resemble real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The individual parts make a strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can't be at the top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits it's sometimes painful to see his structures destroyed.

Asthma is one of the main problems as secondhand smoke damages children's airways in various ways. Researchers led by Maastricht University Medical Center's Jasper Been reviewed no fewer than 11 studies examining how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and preterm birth changed after smoking bans were introduced. The studies included more than 2.5 million births and almost 250,000 hospitalizations for asthma. The result shows that both asthma admissions and preterm birth rates fell by about 10 percent within a year of the introduction of the smoking ban. The impact on preterm births may also have been caused by pregnant women being more likely to quit or downsize after a public ban, Been says. However, Been also says that the studies could not fully prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. However, because the analysis included multiple smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, and most saw health improvements. Such insights are useful for countries and states where there is an ongoing debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially since hospital care for preterm babies is so expensive. This might be one of the most important things to know in order to strengthen legislation. Other studies have shown that heart attack and stroke rates also tend to decrease after smoking bans are implemented.", "qas": [{"question": "Laws on smoking bans in public places are going stricter in     .", "answers": [{"answer_start": 349, "text": "Japan"}], "id": "ea4a403dcddb443ebab99c790c6564bbde"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Camp Jano India Celebrate Indian culture, language, arts, festivals and literature.

The law, due to be passed this month, is likely to start a revolution in family affairs in a country where it is happening 40 % of men reportedly do no housework at all. The draft, approved by the Spanish Parliament's Judiciary Commission, will oblige men to share \"domestic responsibilities and the care and support\" of children and elderly family members. \u201cThis will be a good way to remind people of their duties. Feminists have long wanted this,\u201d said Margarita Uria of the Basque Nationalist Party, which was behind amending a new divorce law. Failure to fulfill the obligations is taken into account by the judges when determining the terms of the divorce. Men who refuse to contribute may be less likely to have contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times more on housework than husbands. Even when both work outside the home, Spanish women still do three times as much domestic work. \"It's not just about housework,\" said Mrs. Uriah. A study conducted five years ago by the Spanish Center for Sociological Research concluded that fathers spend an average of 13 minutes each day caring for their children. Only 19% of Spanish men agreed that mothers of school-age children should have a full-time job. More than a third said mothers should not work outside the home at all. The amendment to the Spanish Code adds domestic duties to a list of spousal duties that currently includes fidelity, cohabitation and mutual aid.

The program works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset released earlier this year. An active shooting situation occurs when one or more armed persons are actively shooting with intent to kill in a small, populated area.

If you are concerned that chocolate is bad for your health, here is a list of dark chocolate health effects, especially when consumed in the right amount each day. First of all, it contains a component called Falconoid that acts as an antioxidant. The antioxidants fight the usual signs of aging. The antioxidants are also good for the heart. Studies have shown that people who eat foods rich in antioxidants have a low risk of heart disease. In addition to the anti-aging and heart-healthy benefits, dark chocolate may also lower blood pressure and lower bad cholesterol by up to 10%. Lowering blood pressure in patients with high blood levels is good because it reduces the risk of stroke and certain health crises. Low blood cholesterol levels are also good for the heart and reduce the risk of blood vessels, which can harden due to too much cholesterol in them.

One of the participants in the study, published in the journal Psychological Science, said, \"Once the children grow up...some of the stress is relieved...the responsibility is taken away, so things are a little more relaxed.\" Psychologist Sara Gorchoff, who conducted the research, said, \"The take-home message for couples with young children is, 'hang in there.'\" Her co-author Oliver John added, \"Wait Don't until your kids leave the house to plan quality time with your partner.\" dr However, Dorothy Rowe of the British Psychological Society said the impact of living in an \"empty nest\" would depend on the relationship parents have with their children. \"If you're just waiting for them to leave the house so you can get on with your life, then obviously you'll be happy when they leave,\" she said, \"but if you build your life around your kids.\" you're going to be terribly lonely.

Most hybrid cars currently on the road are petrol-electric hybrids. The petrol-electric hybrid car is exactly what it sounds like - a cross between a petrol-powered car and an electric car. A gas-powered car has a fuel tank that supplies gasoline to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that power the car. To be useful to you or me, a car should be able to go at least 300 miles (483 km) before refueling, be able to be refueled quickly and easily, and be fast enough to keep up with other traffic on the road to keep. A gasoline car meets these requirements, but causes a large amount of pollutants. However, an electric car causes almost no pollution, but can only travel 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) between charges. And the problem was that the electric car is very slow and cumbersome to charge. A gasoline-electric car combines the advantages of the two energy sources in a system that uses both gas power and electrical energy.

The kid isn't filling out his college applications! If you fear you've allowed your kids to watch too much TV and settle for bad grades, you must face the consequences. In my view, the over-involvement of many parents in the process is a cover for this deep parental fear: did I do well with this child? Did I do everything I had to do for this child? Will this child have a good life? I've seen many parents come back into their children's lives during college admissions time and try to instill all their wisdom and discipline into their children at the last moment. Parents need to be sure when their children leave the nest that they really did teach them to fly. Since the quality of what parents have done for their children cannot be assessed at this point, the next best thing is the status of the college that the child is admitted to. From the perspective of a concerned parent, an \"Ivy l,eague college\" child is evidence of better parenting than a \"small college\" child.

Somehow, going there and defending her parents' upbringing would make her life better. Such fears of letting go of an unfinished child exist in all families.

My wife and I wanted to give James the best education, but that meant we had to work our shifts and spend less time with our child. I asked myself, \"Would that trade-off be worth it?\" Looking at research on child development, I think that might not be the case. Where our children go to school may not matter as much as most American parents realize. Social scientists have long tried to understand why some children grow up successful. In a 2001 study Greg Duncan , Professor of Education at the University of California, measured the influence that the people in a child's life have on how well the child does in school. Duncan and his team found almost no correlation between the students' performance on the test and the participants in the next class, with whom they hung out after school and who lived in their block of flats. In particular, the only meaningful connection they found was between siblings and twins. For a long time, scientists thought that a family's income had a major impact on how well children did in life. But that may not be the case. A series of experiments to measure this found that such results were not caused by income. She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a child has or how often their family goes to museums. Lareau, another scholar, began one of the most profound observations of American parenting. He concluded that success is much more related to the time parents spend with their children. He said: \"Many parents I have interviewed are concerned about their children's future. But they have exaggerated the sense of the risks involved in not giving their children 'the best' of everything.\" So we ultimately decided to leave things as they were.

The story was also the basis of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, which was later adapted into the musical My Fair Lady. In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims he can turn a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a duchess. But, as Eliza herself points out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it's not what she learns or does that determines whether she becomes a duchess, but how she's treated. The impact of the Pygmalion Effect on leaders and managers is enormous. That means your team's performance depends less on them than on you.

A professor who does research over at medical school was talking about attention blindness, the fundamental trait of the human brain that causes us to miss almost everything else when we're concentrating on a task. Because we can't see what we can't see, our instructor was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people throwing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our job was to just watch the throws among the people in white. The tape rolled and everyone started counting. All except me. I'm dyslexic and the moment I saw the video of the confusing basketball throws I knew I wouldn't be able to follow their movements so I let my mind wander. However, I got curious when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla walked in between the players. She (we later learned there was a student in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, pounded her fist on her chest, and then walked away while they continued to pass the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball throws. Hands went up everywhere. He then asked who counted 13, 14 and congratulated those who got the perfect score 15 . Then he asked: \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to find that I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the large room to do so. He had tricked us and trapped us in our own attention blindness. Yes, it was a prank, but he wasn't the one who played it on us. By focusing so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is the brain's basic organizing principle and I believe it presents us with a great opportunity. I see it differently from many neuroscientists: where they see the deficits of the individual, I see an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control and utilize our various forms of attention. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learned about paying attention means we've missed everything else. It's not easy for us logical, intelligent, and confident types to admit that the real key to our success - our ability to spot a problem and solve it, an achievement we've made through all our years in school and have attained beyond that \u2013 these very limits can be us.

BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are those light and flimsy dolly shoes. Part of the problem is their flatness, like Keds and Vans. However, ballet flats that don't have a thong or heel have other specific problems. \"Because the shoe has no fastening device, it relies on the toes to put the shoe on, resulting in an awkward gait, leading to short- and long-term problems such as calluses, heel and knee pain.\" WEDGES AND STILETTS These shoes can also cause walking problems. While they look good, the heels of these shoes are so high that they can push the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Even teenagers who wear these shoes regularly risk joining the millions of women with chronic back pain. SCHOOL SHOES What do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday wear? Something made out of a natural, breathable fabric, with a cord to hold it in place, with a small heel and a deep toe box that doesn't pinch your toes like Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing \"bad\" shoes, get them plain insoles in their shoes. These support and correct the movement of the foot and when properly fitted by a podiatrist can often alter their gait and stop the damage.", "qas": [{"question": "Of all the shoes mentioned in the passage, which can cause the worst problems?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 676, "text": "BALLET PUMPS"}], "id": "3c060f8f033345a8a16d31b89fa63d50de"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Education plays a very important role in everyone's life. We go to school because we want to know more about the world around us. The typical classroom used to be the place where teachers and students worked together and explored the wonderful world of knowledge, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one of these approaches. Learning via the Internet is a new style that seems to be becoming more successful than traditional classrooms. The Internet provides schools with a vast amount of learning material that students can access online. Due to online course selection, completing a program becomes much easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spend hours looking for the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house that is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience as a first time mom, I find that using online information is very helpful. While I'm at home with my baby, I can still look for the materials I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my house. The Internet is not only a great supplier of information, but also saves money and time. People assume that education will be much cheaper in the future due to internet access to information. The cost of land, buildings and teachers' wages is constantly increasing. In addition, regular courses (offline) rely heavily on books and other paper-based materials online education Publishes lectures and assignments electronically, saving thousands of dollars each year. With no physical limitations, the internet classes and classes are also very enjoyable. Classroom tuition has a limited number of students, while online tuition is open to all. Students don't have to struggle to sign up for classes they like. Students have more opportunities to complete their courses and classes online. The Internet offers a wonderful opportunity to acquire knowledge more conveniently and cheaply.

At one point, she suffered a nervous breakdown because of his cruel and reckless behavior. She took her children with her and decided to leave home, but didn't know her destination. This all took place in a small town in Kansas called Frontenac. She had very little gas in her tank and no money at all and she didn't even make it out of Frontenac. When she ran out of gas, she panicked. Then she went to a house without knowing the owner. She \"put her pride in her pocket\" and headed for the door. After explaining her situation to an old lady who answered the door, the lady asked her husband to help Jan carry the children inside. These kind people allowed her to stay two weeks until she received some money in the mail from one. They fed and cared for Jan and her children.

To make it a realistic yet exciting story, I decided I had to make a jump myself first. Unfortunately, I'm not good at any sport, let alone skydiving. My friend Mr. Smith was willing to help me. He took me to an elementary school. The first day of training included several lessons, but not my first jump from an airplane. I had to wait until the next morning for that. The next morning, after a hasty, anxious breakfast, I was taken to the airfield. There, two heavy parachutes were placed on my back. Then I was asked to go to a small plane that had just slowly stopped on the runway. Once on the plane, things soon went uphill. I was starting to get nervous. When we reached a thousand yards, Harry, my teacher, hooked a line from my parachute to a steel ring on the plane. The line should open my parachute after I jumped. \"Get ready, Henry,\" Harry said. I cautiously walked to the door. I wanted to cry, \"No, no, no!\" but not a word came. \"Leap!\" shouted Harry loudly. \"Leap!\" To my surprise, kicking like a frog, I jumped. Off the plane, and down, down, I fell. It worked! The air seemed to keep me upright. I was very happy . Then I felt a quick pull. My big parachute had opened!
