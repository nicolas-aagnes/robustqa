Sensor size Along with the number of megapixels, the size of the sensor determines the camera's overall image quality and low-light performance. It also determines whether the camera can electronically make the details it captures bigger enough for you to see - making the photos not clear enough to see when viewed on a larger screen. Portability \"The most important thing is that the camera isn't too big or heavy and that you have a good zoom range for both wide-angle and telephoto shots,\" Atherton told CNN. A good choice would be a thin, light pocket camera with a high-quality built-in optical zoom. \"These are very popular for travel because they're lightweight, but built with a telephoto lens that can zoom in up to 60 times,\" Atherton said. Zoom and shutter speed For action or crowd shots, a fast shutter speed is a key factor. \"When you're dealing with something that's active \u2014 wildlife or people in action on the street \u2014 faces change within a tiny fraction of a second,\" Arnold said, \"a fast shutter speed comes in handy when taking the hundreds of photos you might need get that one winning shot.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What will contribute to a satisfactory photo of a running lion in the wild?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 973, "text": "shutter speed"}], "id": "b972e2ba473a4974bc7573f4de739abcnl"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "My grandmother seems to be wrong when she says that good manners will never go out of style.

Gray wolves are their ancestors. Scientists are pretty consistent about that.

Boyko of Cornell University, and an international group of other scientists, studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or village dogs. dr. Shannon analyzed three different types of DNA, said Dr. Boyko, the first time this was done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin for dogs, in much the same way genetic studies have traced the origins of modern humans in East Africa. The analysis, said Dr. Boyko, pointed to Central Asia, as the place where \"all the dogs alive today\" come from. The data didn't allow for a precise dating of its origin, he said, but showed it occurred at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson from the University of Oxford, which is leading a major international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed with the study. \"It's really great to see not only the number of mutts, but also the latitude and number of remote locations where the dogs were sampled,\" he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different types of DNA and the methods of analysis. dr. Larson, who was not involved in the study, said he thought the finding needed further testing in Central Asia.

Experts say it all started with a song by the American singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. He was one of the country's top blues musicians until his death in 1983. His music influenced singers such as Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. In 1950, Muddy Waters recorded a song called \"Rolling Stone\". A British rock group is said to have taken its name from the Muddy Waters song. The Rolling Stones first performed in 1962. The members of the group called themselves \"the greatest rock and roll band in the world.\" In 1965 Bob Dylan released his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\". It is one of his best known and most influential works. It is an angry song about a woman who was once rich and successful. But now she stands alone, \"with no direction home, like a complete stranger, like a rolling stone\". In 1967, a young man named Jann Wenner started a magazine and called it \"Rolling Stone\".

The inside of the Earth is relatively close, but how do we get there? The deepest oil well goes just six miles into the crust (the center of the Earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug deepest hole in Siberia, found about 7.5 miles under the surface. The Mohole Project, a US plan in the 1950s, called for the drilling of a 25-mile hole to the boundary between the crust's hard rocks and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the project involved government support. Drilling deep into the earth is getting harder and harder as rocks get softer. Hard but easy to break at the surface, rocks at depth become plastic, and the pressure created by the weight of the overlying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the Earth's interior (such as the fact that it has a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from circumstantial evidence, such as earthquake analysis. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method of exploring the Earth's interior. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson proposes to dig a fissure about half a mile long, a meter wide and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of an atomic bomb. He would then pour several hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the fissure, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move down at about 5 meters per second, carrying the robot and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would fall to the outer edge of the Earth's core for about a week and 2,000 miles, with the robot sending data to the surface. Stevenson likens his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we haven't been before,\" he says. \"There will most likely be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt just about anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem.

During the First World War, the first bomb to hit the UK fell in Dover , and it also served as a prominent location during World War II. And today, the city is best known for the beauty of its chalky white cliffs. * Mount Thor, Canada The name Mount Thor can inspire fear or respect -- and it should, since it's the steepest, tallest cliff in the world. Thor reaches an astonishing 4,101 feet above sea level, and the sheer magnitude of its vertical inclination prevented it from successfully ascending until 1965. Today it remains a challenging and popular place for mountaineers. ' * Cliffs of Etretat, France Located on the French Alabaster Coast, these cliffs offer more than just sheer walls. Climb to the top and you'll have views of vaulted rock formations, as well as the landscape that inspired the famous painter Claude Monet.

One way this works is by wearing clothes in different colors. When we are sad, we normally wear dark clothes with 1 color. When we are happy, on the other hand, we often choose to wear brightly colored clothes. The reason for this is that our choice of color1 mirrors is how we feel. Those who don't believe in the idea you often hear the saying: \"If only this really worked\". Well, in response to those people, a lot of research has been done on what happens to a person's feelings when they are asked to wear only one color1 of clothing. It has been proven that if we wear certain colors of clothes, they can change our feelings. Suppose we feel sad, wearing black can make us feel worse. However, if we wear green, red or yellow, we can start to feel better. Each color1 would have its own healing power.

A number of students have already emailed me about the course. I'm sure you don't understand what a big problem it is to open this program in our school. People all over the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many rewards available for the students who pass the course. Please share what I have said with the administration.

That is why I find the dividing line between things and experiences more nuanced than at first glance. But to be happy, the most important thing is what kind of purchases you have made. Sometimes we all have purchases that seem like wasted money, like probably half the clothes in our closets, but how come?' There are many reasons why this happens. The biggest is that we spend a lot of our time working to earn money to buy things. The problem is that we buy a lot of things that we don't really need.

The problem is so serious that urgent action is needed, warns the study, led by British and Chinese researchers. The survey surveyed 2,191 students aged nine to 12 at nine schools in urban and rural Zhejiang, a highly affluent coastal province in eastern China. Eighty-one percent of teens said they were \"very concerned\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had at least been physically bullied \u2014 with boys being victimized before girls \u2014 and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most children complained that they had difficulty with the amount of homework they were given. More than a third reported headaches or stomachaches - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported an incidence of aches and pains four times a week. The study, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at the Center for International Health and Development at University College London (UCL), pointed to the extreme competitiveness of the Chinese education system, from the beginning of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" say the authors. \"There is an urgent need to take steps to reduce unnecessary stress for children at school.\" The article appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The 'urban' setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the 'rural' setting was a poor province in Quzhou Prefecture, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that, it says, explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the dramatic rise in the country's wealth, which has led to \"previously unheard of opportunities for upward mobility\" and which in turn has increased the pressure on children to do well in school. Other reasons include China's one-child policy and Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, piety, obedience and discipline. \u201cThe aspirations of many parents, who themselves had limited educational opportunities, are now being invested in their only children,\u201d it says. Previous studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are scarce and generally come from Scandinavia. A 2008 review of 10- to 13-year-olds in Sweden found that 21 percent of boys and 30 percent of girls had headaches, and 17 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls had a stomachache at least once a week.", "qas": [{"question": "What mainly caused schoolchildren to suffer from psychological ill-health?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 102, "text": "classroom stress and parental pressure"}], "id": "2b5bd91c586b406e9a3b3ae74a737608nl"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "According to a study released Thursday by the Nielson Company, China has become a global tourist attraction after the Beijing Olympics.

The ferry can sail up to 7.5 knots on wind and solar energy only. They are solar wings and fiberglass solar panels that not only absorb sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \u201cWe aim our solar panels at the sun in two planes, increasing the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\u201d says Dane. \"And we can also use that same structure to do another job, whatever the sail, and so these wing sails push the ferry forward, just like a soft sail does.\" Computers monitor the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to capture the most sunlight. When there's not much wind or it's a cloudy day, the energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. \u201cIf the batteries are too low, the computer turns on the generator so the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B anyway,\u201d explains Dan.

If so, it might sound like a famous ballpoint pen maker BIC. It is argued that Goldman Sach's famous marketing tool, the BRICs, should actually be the BICs. \"Is Russia Really Worthy of BRIC's Name?\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who also co-authored \"The Russian Balance Sheet\" with Andrew Kuchins, thinks Putin and Medvedev's Russia just isn't worth living alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic superpowers. He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one has to wonder if it has anything to say about the global economy at all, compared to the other members of its group. I just got back from Moscow, that always boring around this season. Over the past seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state lives off oil and gas.\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will decline by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow by 8.5 percent and India by 5.4 percent. There is less reason for Brazil, with a 0.7 percent drop, but it is still doing much better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing tool to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it could be argued that Russia leads the BRICs.

As school budgets shrink, more and more schools in the US are selling advertising space on lockers and buses and in gyms or cafeterias. It is an easy way for schools to make money. And ads can provide exhausted parents with relief by donating money to support schools. Although parents can always turn off the televisions or computers, they cannot keep advertising out of the schools. This is not the first time the problem has popped up. For example, a teen news program has been criticized for including ads in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts. And parent groups successfully fought a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and advertisements on school buses. But now things are different. Last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow businesses to advertise in the district's schools. Officials say the plan could bring in as much as $18 million for the schools. In St. Francis, Minnesota, schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their lockers with advertisements. The time says. Edward Saxton, a teacher at the school, says: \"Until now, parents have accepted this as a way to bring in the money they need. The money pays for programs such as arts, sports and music. Parents don't like to see programs being aborted. Me neither.

Now airlines have to adjust their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's largest airlines, aircraft cannot go under or over the cloud. If you go through the cloud, ash can get trapped in the aircraft's engines and cause damage to the aircraft. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glassy rocks all over the countryside.

How do such crowding problems arise, and can they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which traffic jams arise: the flow of road traffic. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed traffic flow models. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They viewed the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing through a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the liquid becomes denser. In the beginning, the flow rate increases as the density increases because you just get through more stuff in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of congestion and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses the same principle that flow velocity first increases and then decreases as runners' density increases, thanks to a sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there are a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, each of which maintains throughout the race. Using only these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at any point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on race conditions - for example for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by having all the runners start at once (meaning the back ones have to wait for the front ones to move forward). Others assign runners to different groups based on ability and have them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half marathon in central Germany, which draws some 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, as police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure runners could cross safely. It can go over a 60 meter wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blockage in the different options. The model predicted that a mass takeoff would risk overloading runners if the bridge were used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the figures assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of congestion at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The organizers of the run consulted the Treiber team and ultimately opted for this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2958, "text": "dangerous blocking"}], "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e72nl"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on income and appearances in magazines, newspapers, TV shows and online.

Sounds incredible, doesn't it? Not if the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He has made a career of building fantastic houses of cards, stadiums, capitals, castles -- and the world's tallest card tower. How is he doing? Bryan's structures are astonishing as they are made entirely from perfectly balanced, freestanding playing cards. He never uses glue, tape or anything else to hold the cards together. He also does not fold the cards. He has discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, with a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells with hard walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems maintain their shape. Bees use the same kind of repeating pattern to make strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids and uses maps to create a repeating pattern of cells. He starts with a single cell that he creates by balancing four cards against each other to form a box. Then it repeats the cell over and over and expands outwards to form the grid, which is a good foundation for a strong map structure. The larger the grille, the more weight it can support. Sometimes Bryan uses multiple cards, instead of just one, to build the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when speaking in class, is to place your cards as close together as possible when laying out your grid, making sure the cards aren't leaning at all. After building this solid foundation, Bryan lays cards over the top to make the floor for the next \"story\" of the building. He can add towers, columns, towers or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of amazing power. In the cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \"We were in the middle of nowhere,\" Bryan recalls, \"with a lot of room to do what we wanted. I was always making something, with things like sticks or hay bales.\" Bryan's grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan's two interests -- building and stacking cards -- soon converged. But stacking in his family's farm was a challenge. \u201cOur old house had wooden floors that weren't all flat,\u201d he reports. \"And they weren't very sturdy. When people were walking around, it was like 'earthquake'. It was a challenge to build something that wouldn't fall over right away.\" Bryan built tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before building something bigger than himself. When he put a few piles of cards on his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's towers began to grow taller. How long is too long? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world's tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. When Bryan learned that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, he built a slender tower with a top of 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then, he has won world records for even taller buildings. His last winner was 25 feet 3.5 inches and used about 2,400 decks of cards. _ Why don't these towers fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a repeating pattern of stories and a tapered top. Bryan likes to point out how map buildings resemble real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The individual parts form one strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But weight can't all be on top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits that seeing his buildings destroyed is sometimes painful.

The finding should allay fears that such laws could have the opposite effect, as they could lead to more people smoking in their homes. Different countries, such as Japan and Australia have tightened laws on smoking in public places in recent years. Meanwhile, in some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, smoking is still allowed in cafes and restaurants. Only about half of US states have comprehensive bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer countries. Opponents often argue that a ban could lead people to smoke more at home, which would be worse for the health of their children. Asthma is one of the biggest concerns as secondhand smoke harms children's airways in several ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been of Maastricht University Medical Center reviewed no fewer than 11 studies examining how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and preterm birth changed after a smoking ban went into effect. The studies covered more than 2.5 million births and nearly 250,000 hospitalizations for asthma. The result shows that both the number of asthma admissions and the number of preterm births decreased by about 10 percent within a year of smoking restrictions. The effect on preterm births could also have been caused by pregnant women being more likely to quit or cut down after a public ban, Been says. But Be also says the studies couldn't fully prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. However, in fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, most of them saw health improvements. Such findings are helpful for countries and states where there is ongoing debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially since hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This is arguably one of the most important things to know to strengthen legislation. Other studies have shown that the number of heart attacks and strokes also decreases after the smoking ban is introduced.", "qas": [{"question": "Laws on smoking bans in public places are going stricter in     .", "answers": [{"answer_start": 349, "text": "Japan"}], "id": "ea4a403dcddb443ebab99c790c6564bbnl"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Camp Jano India Celebrate Indian culture, languages, arts, festivals and literature.

That is the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees in how to handle an active shooting situation in the workplace. The program works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset that was released earlier this year. An active shooting situation is when an armed person or people are actively shooting into a small, populated area with the intent to kill. There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year saw the deadliest active shooting in US history, killing 49 at an Orlando nightclub. In the training situation, users have four choices. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, maybe in the office closet. They can run to an exit. Or they can use something in the office - a computer or a cup or a pair of scissors - as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement over standard active shooting training. Gallo says that people are typically teachers to lock themselves in place and hide. The \"lock-down\" method is often: ineffective , he says, and has led to many deaths in recent years. In the basic level of training, no one is killed. But as the workouts get more sophisticated, players who make the wrong choice get shot. There is no blood; the screen just slowly goes black. If this sounds terrifying, that's the point, Gallo says. There are numerous training programs to help employees deal with workplace violence, sometimes involving toy gun role-playing.

If you're concerned that chocolate is bad for your health, here's a list of dark chocolate's health effects, especially when taken in the right amount every day. First, it contains a compound called falconoid, which acts as an antioxidant. The antioxidants fight the common signs of aging. The antioxidants are also good for the heart. Studies have shown that people who ate foods rich in antioxidants have a low risk of heart disease. In addition to its anti-aging and heart health benefits, dark chocolate can also lower blood pressure and lower bad cholesterol by up to 10%. Lowering blood pressure in patients with high blood levels is good because it lowers the risk of stroke and certain health problems. Low blood cholesterol is also good for the heart and reduces the risk of blood vessels that can harden because of too much cholesterol. Finally, do you know the feeling of being overjoyed after a jog? This feeling is like extreme happiness. Dark chocolates give you the feeling of pleasure and happiness. If you feel like the world has turned against you, a chocolate can lift your mood. It can help fight depression. When we feel this bad, we usually crave more food.

However, a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that many couples actually feel happier when their kids move out because they can enjoy time together.

Researchers think this isn't just because the spouses spent more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company.

A gas car has a fuel tank, which supplies the engine with gasoline. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that power the car. To be useful to you or me, a car must be able to drive a minimum of 300 miles before refueling, refuel quickly and easily, and fast enough to keep up with the rest of the traffic on the road. A petrol car meets these requirements but causes a lot of pollution. However, an electric car produces almost no pollution, but can only travel 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) between charges. And the problem was that the electric car is very slow and inconvenient to charge. A petrol-electric car combines the advantages of the two power sources in one system that uses both gas and electricity.

As the title suggests, movement is central to How Do Animals Move?

Several unconventional variations (e.g. looping of inchworms, the rectilinear movement of snakes) are included. Again, the photographs and diagrams clearly support the double-page spread of discussions about animal movements.

Parents may need to be sure that when they leave the nest, their children have actually taught them how to fly. Since it is currently impossible to judge the quality of what parents have done for their children, the status of the college the child is admitted to is the second best there is. From a concerned parent's point of view, an \"Ivy l, eague college\" child is evidence of a better upbringing than a \"little college\" child. I once sat with a talented, frail senior girl and her brilliant parents. She, she and the school had to decide whether to change schools or go to the hospital. In light of her anorexia( ), the school strongly advised her not to submit her early application to Princeton. Hearing this, the girl looked at the adults in the room and said, \"If I can't sign up for Princeton early, I'm going to die.\" Her parents also wanted her to go to Princeton. Why did they need all this so badly? Because in this case something was wrong in the family. Due to a weakness in her upbringing, this child was not happy or confident. Yet she was eighteen, the culture required that she had to leave the house. The psychological solution for all of them was the comforting vision of a\u2026 great college \u2020 Somehow, her life there would make good and defend her parents' upbringing. Such fears about letting go of an uneducated child exist in all families. How can we let go of a child so young in so many ways? It is painful and has no cure except time and hope.

Where our kids go to school may matter less than most American parents think. Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children grow up to be successful. Greg Duncan , a professor of education at the University of California, measures the influence people have in a child's life on how well the child does in school. Duncan and his team found almost no association between how students did on the test and who they sat next to in class, who they socialized with after school, and who lived in their block.

She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively cheap: the number of books a child has or how often his family goes to museums.

He said: \"Many parents I interviewed are concerned about the future of their children.

The Self-fulfilling Effect Also known as the Pygmalion effect. This comes from an ancient Greek story. The story was also the basis of George Bernard Shaw's play \"Pygmalion\", later turned into the musical \"My Fair Lady\". In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims he can turn a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a Duchess. But, as Eliza herself points out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it's not what she learns or does that determines whether she becomes a Duchess, but how she is treated. The implication of the Pygmalion effect for leaders and managers is enormous. It means your team's performance depends less on them than on you. The performance you get from people is neither more nor less than you expect, which means you should always expect the best. As Goethe said, \"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is.

A medical school professor talked about attention blindness, the basic feature of the human brain that, when we focus on one task, causes us to miss just about everything else. Since we can't see what we can't see, our teacher was determined to catch us in the act. He showed us a video of six people throwing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our job was to keep track of only the throws between the people in white. The tape rolled and everyone started counting. Everyone but me. I'm dyslexic and the moment I saw that bond with the confusing basketball throwers I knew I wouldn't be able to follow their movements, so I let my mind wander. However, I got curious when about 30 seconds after the shot a gorilla came in between the players. She (we later learned that a college girl was in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, slammed her fist on her chest, and then left as they continued to pass the balls. When the tape ended, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball throws. Hands went up everywhere. He then asked who counted 13, 14 and congratulated those who scored the perfect one 15 \u2020 Then he asked, \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to find that I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the main room to do so. He had set us up, trapped us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one to pull it off with us. By focusing so much on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is the basic organizing principle of the brain and I believe it offers us a great opportunity. My view is different from that of many neuroscientists: where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I feel an opportunity for collaboration. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control and take advantage of our different forms of attention.

He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one has to wonder if it has anything to say about the global economy at all, compared to the other members of its group. I just got back from Moscow, that is always boring around this season. For the past seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state lives off oil and gas.\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will decline by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow by 8.5 percent and India by 5.4 percent. There is less reason for Brazil, with a 0.7 percent drop, but it is still doing much better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing tool to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it could be argued that Russia leads the BRICs. The stock market is up 128 percent this year, compared to about 80 percent for the other three. In any case, despite Russia's underperformance in the economy, its outperformance in the stock market suggests that it does indeed belong to the group.", "qas": [{"question": "According to the passage, which country will enjoy the biggest increase in 2009?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 571, "text": "China"}], "id": "7a13950a8cec4603aac9085f2f0b9f91nl"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Vans, Keds, Dollies - they sound like rock band names, but if you have teens, you know these are the latest teen shoes. But experts are now warning that current shoe fashions will cause short-term discomfort for teens and cause years of foot, knee and back pain in the future. Here, the experts identify the problems caused by teens' shoe choice. KEDS/VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are especially popular among teenage boys, with Keds and Vans being the most sought-after brands. The main problem is that they are just too flat - so flat that the heel, which hits the ground first, also gets damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are such light and thin dolly shoes. Part of the problem is their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However, ballet pumps, which do not have a drawstring or heel, have other specific problems. \"Because the shoe has no fastener, it relies on the toes to keep the shoe on, causing an awkward gait. This leads to short- and long-term problems such as calluses, heel and knee pain.\" WEDGES AND STILETTOS These shoes can also cause walking difficulties. They may look good, but the heels are so high that they can push the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teens who regularly wear these shoes are also at risk of joining those millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES What do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday use? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a string to hold it on, with a small heel and a deep toe box that doesn't press on the toes, like Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing \"bad\" shoes, get some simple foot orthotics in the shoes. These support and correct the movement of the foot and, when properly applied by a podiatrist, can often alter their gait and stop the damage.", "qas": [{"question": "Of all the shoes mentioned in the passage, which can cause the worst problems?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 676, "text": "BALLET PUMPS"}], "id": "3c060f8f033345a8a16d31b89fa63d50nl"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Education plays a very important role in everyone's life. We go to school because we want to know more about the world around us. The typical classroom used to be the place where teachers and students worked and explored the wonderful world of knowledge together, but now everything has changed. The internet is one of those approaches. Online learning is a new style that seems to be gaining success over traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a large amount of learning material that is accessible to students online. The choice of courses online makes completing a program a lot easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spend hours looking for the right resources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, being a first-time mother, I find that using online information is very helpful. While I am at home with my baby, I can still search for the materials I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my home. The internet is not only a great information provider, but also a money and time saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future because of internet access to information. The costs of land, buildings and wages for teachers are constantly rising. In addition, regular courses (offline) rely heavily on books and other paper-based materials, while online education posts lectures and assignments electronically, saving thousands of dollars each year. Without physical limitations, the internet lessons and courses are also very useful. In classroom education, there is a restriction on the number of students, while internet education is available to everyone. Students don't have to struggle to enroll in classes they enjoy. Students have more choice to take their courses and classes online. The internet offers a wonderful opportunity to acquire knowledge in an easier and cheaper way.
