Sensor Size Along with the megapixel count, the size of the sensor dictates the overall image quality as well as the camera's performance in low light. It also determines if the camera can electronically set the details it captures larger enough to see - which is why the images are not clear enough to see when you view the images on a larger screen. Portability \"The important thing is that the camera is not too big or heavy and that you have a good zoom range for both wide-angle and telephoto shots,\" Atherton told CNN. A good choice would be a sleek, lightweight pocket camera with a high-quality built-in optical zoom. \"These are very popular for travel as they are lightweight but built with a telephoto lens that can zoom up to 60 times,\" Atherton said. Zoom and shutter speed For action or audience shots, a fast shutter speed is a key factor. \"When dealing with something active - wildlife or people in action on the street - faces change in a matter of seconds,\" Arnold said, \"a fast shutter speed is useful for taking the hundreds of pictures, you may need to get the only winning shot. \"", "qas": [{"question": "What will contribute to a satisfactory photo of a running lion in the wild?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 973, "text": "shutter speed"}], "id": "b972e2ba473a4974bc7573f4de739abcda"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "My grandmother seems to be wrong when she says that good manners will never go out of fashion.

Gray wolves are their ancestors. Researchers are pretty consistent about it. And researchers have suggested that dogs' origins can be dated back to Europe, the Middle East, Siberia and southern China. Central Asia is the newest and best candidate according to a large study of dogs from all over the world. Laura M. Shannon and Adam R. Boyko at Cornell University and an international group of other scientists studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or village dogs. Dr. Shannon analyzed three different kinds of DNA, said Dr. Boyko, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin of dogs in much the same way that genetic studies have located the origins of modern humans in East Africa. The analysis, said Dr. Boyko, pointed to Central Asia as the place where \"all the dogs that live today\" come from. The data did not allow accurate dating of the origin, he said, but showed that it took place at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson from Oxford University, who is leading a major international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed with the study. \"It's really amazing to see not only the number of stray dogs, but also the geographical latitude and the number of remote locations where the dogs were tested,\" he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different kinds of DNA and the methods of analysis. Dr. Larson, who was not involved in the investigation, said he believed the findings from Central Asia required further testing.

The Earth's interior is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well penetrates just six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but reached the bottom approx 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the project involved state aid. It is getting harder and harder to drill deep into the ground because rocks are getting softer and softer. Hard but slightly cracked at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. The little we know about the earth's interior (like the fact that there is a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method of exploring the earth's interior. Researcher David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson proposes to dig a crack about half a mile long, one yard wide and half a mile deep (not with a shovel), but with an explosion the size of an atomic bomb. Next, he poured a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The mass of iron would fall in about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth's core, where the robot sent data out to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we've not been before,\" he says. \"With all the possibilities, there will be surprises.\" This idea can certainly be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot had to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much everything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem.

In response to these people, there has been a lot of research into what happens to a person's emotions when they are asked to wear only one color1 clothing. It has been proven that if we wear certain colors on clothes, they can change our emotions. Suppose we feel sad, if we wear black, we can start to get worse. But if we wear green, red or yellow, we can start to get better. Each color1 is said to have its own healing power.

Therefore, I think the dividing line between things and experiences is more nuanced than at first glance. But to be happy, the most important thing is what kind of purchase you have made. Sometimes we can all have purchases that seem like a waste of money like probably half the clothes in our closets, but how does that happen? ' There are many reasons why this happens. The biggest thing is that we spend a lot of our time working to make money buying things. The problem is that we buy a lot of things that we do not actually need.

The problem is so bad that urgent action is needed, warns the study, led by British and Chinese researchers. The study surveyed 2,191 students aged nine to 12 at nine schools in rural and rural Zhejiang, a very prosperous coastal province in eastern China. 81 percent of young people said they worried \"a lot\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had been physically bullied at least sometimes - with boys more likely to be victims than girls - and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained that they had difficulty coping with the amount of homework they were given. Over a third reported headaches or abdominal pain - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported the occurrence of soreness four times a week. The study, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at the University College London (UCL) Center for International Health and Development, pointed to extreme competitiveness in China's education system, right from the beginning of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" the authors say. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be introduced immediately.\" The article appears in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" environment for the study was Hangzhou, Zhejiang's provincial capital, while the \"rural\" environment was a poor county in Quzhou Prefecture in the western part of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that, according to it, explain the requirements for academic expertise and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatic rise in prosperity, which has created \"previously unheard of opportunities for upward mobility\" and again increased the pressure on children to do well in school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and the Confucian traditions of respect for parents and the elderly, childish piety, obedience and discipline. \"The hopes of many parents, who themselves had limited educational opportunities, are now invested in their only children,\" it says. Previous studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are few and generally come from Scandinavia. An assessment from 2008 among 10- to 13-year-olds in Sweden showed that 21 percent of the boys out of 30 percent of the girls experienced headaches, and 17 percent of the boys and 28 percent of the girls experienced abdominal pain at least once a week.", "qas": [{"question": "What mainly caused schoolchildren to suffer from psychological ill-health?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 102, "text": "classroom stress and parental pressure"}], "id": "2b5bd91c586b406e9a3b3ae74a737608da"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "According to a study published by the Nielson Company on Thursday, China has become a global tourist attraction after the Beijing Olympics.

The ferry can run up to 7.5 knots on only wind and solar energy. These are solar wings and fiberglass solar panels that not only absorb sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \u201cWe angle our solar panels to the sun in two planes, which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\u201d Dane says. \"And we can also use the same structure to do another job, which is also sailed, and then these wing sails actually push the ferry forward, just like a soft sail does.\" Computers check the sun and wind and angle the sun wings to absorb most sunlight. If there is not much wind or it is an overcast day, the energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. \"If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns on the generator so the boat is always able to adhere to a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,\" Dan explains. Dane got his idea for the Sun Sailor from a book on insects.

Blocks are generally connected to specific neighborhoods; they include both a music group and a lot of partygoers. Block parades have become an expressive feature of Rio's Carnival.

If so, it may end up sounding like a famous pen manufacturer BIC. An argument is made that Goldman Sachs' famous marketing unit, the BRICs, really should be the BICs. \"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins for \"The Russian Balance Sheet\", believes that Putin's and Medvedev's Russia just is not worthy of being included with Brazil, India and China on the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one has to ask whether it has any impact on the global economy at all compared to the other members of its group. I have just returned home from Moscow, which is always \"Boring around this season. In the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has lived off oil and gas.\" Financially, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund states that the Russian economy will decline by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less case for Brazil with a drop of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing tool to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it can be argued that Russia leads the BRICs.

But how can you protect a child from a large fast food ad painted on her school locker? Or a toy ad on the side of his school bus? As school budgets shrink, an increasing number of schools in the United States sell advertising space on lockers and buses and in gyms or cafeterias. It's an easy way for schools to make money. And ads can provide relief for exhausted parents by providing cash donations in support of schools. While parents can always turn off the television or computers, they can not keep commercials away from schools. This is not the first time the problem has surfaced. For example, a news program for teens has been criticized for including ads in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts. And parent groups successfully opposed a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and commercials on school buses. But now things are different. Just last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow businesses to advertise in district schools. Officials say the plan could provide as much as $ 18 million to schools. In St. Francis, Minn., Schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their closets with ads. Time says. Edward Saxton, a teacher at the school, says: \"So far, parents have accepted this as a way to get the money they need. The money pays for programs like arts, sports and music. Parents do not like to see programs being cut down. Nor do I. In addition, schools are constantly thinking about the effects on children. \"But Susan Linn, an educational expert, says:\" Children have already seen enough ads on television, in magazines and the products they use daily.

It increases our satisfaction when we are happy, and decreases our problems when we are sad. Whatever our main purpose of reading, our contact with good books should never fail to give us enjoyment and satisfaction. With a good book in hand, we never have to be lonely. Whether the characters in it are taken from real life or purely imaginary, they can become our companions and friends. In the pages of the books we can walk with the wise and good in all countries and at all times. The people we meet in books can rejoice, either because they look like human friends that we care about or because they present unknown types that we are happy to welcome as new acquaintances. Our human friends can sometimes bore us, but the friends we make in books never have to tire us with their company. By turning the page, we can reject them without fear of hurting their feelings. While human friends leave us, good books are always ready to give us friendship, sympathy and encouragement. Of all gifts from reading books, the most valuable is experience. Few of us can travel far from home or have a wide range of experiences, but we can all live a varied life through the pages of books. Whether we want to escape from the seemingly boring realities of daily routines, or whether we long to visit a remote place, a book will help us when nothing else can. To travel by book, we do not need a bank account to pay our way; no airship or ocean-going ship or streamlined trains to transport us; no passport to enter the land of our heart's desires. Through books we can get the thrill of _ adventure without danger. We can climb high mountains, brave the dangers of an Antarctic winter, or cross the burning sands of the desert, all effortlessly. In books we can visit the studios in Hollywood; we can mingle with the happy crowds on the boulevards of Paris; we can join the picturesque peasants of an alpine village or the friendly natives of a South Sea island. Actually through books _. The possibilities of our literary experiences are almost limitless. The beauties of nature, the enjoyment of music, the treasures of art, the triumphs of architecture, the wonders of engineering are all open to the amazement and enjoyment of those who read.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the most suitable title for this passage?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1275, "text": "gifts from reading"}], "id": "5e83058255df407194d1997705ac41aada"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "A volcanic eruption in Iceland has sent ash all over northern Europe.

What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies beneath a giant glacier of ice up to 12 meters thick. The hot volcano heats the ice over it, which then forms a layer of water between the glacier and the volcano, which keeps it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure rises. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. That is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash.

But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that can be a daunting prospect. \"I have to admit I was completely frustrated with the blockage and for 18-19 miles just kept myself away from people and was stopped,\" a participant grumbled after the London Marathon 2012. \"I had to overtake a lot of people and ended up with bruised forearms from all elbows, \"said another. How do such congestion problems occur and can they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system where queues arise - road traffic. Martin Treiber, from the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model the flow of traffic was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham from Manchester University. They viewed the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and watched as the flow changes as the liquid becomes denser. To begin with, the flow rate increases as the density increases, as you simply get several things through in the same amount of time. However, if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of paper jams and the flow drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses the same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to a sudden shift from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there are a number of different preferred speeds for different runners, each of which maintains throughout the race. With precisely these factors, the Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners by knowing the \"carrying capacity\" of each point on the route. This allows the Treiber to figure out how blocking may depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start with letting all the runners go at once (which means they have to wait at the back until they have moved forward). Others assign runners to different groups according to ability and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has used the model for the annual Rennsteig half marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013 because police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blockage caused by the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the assumed figures in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of queuing at the bridge. On the other hand no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The running organizers consulted Treiber's team and eventually chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2958, "text": "dangerous blocking"}], "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e72da"}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on income and appearances in magazines, newspapers, TV shows and online.

That sounds incredible, right? Not if the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He has made a career out of building amazing card houses, stadiums, capital cities, castles - and the world's tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan's structures are amazing because they're made entirely of perfectly balanced, free-standing playing cards. He never uses glue, tape or anything else to hold the cards together. He does not fold the cards either. He has discovered another way to make a strong house of cards using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have hard walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a lattice that helps leaves and stems to keep their shape. Bees use the same kind of repetitive pattern to create strong gingerbread cookies where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids by using cards to create a repetitive pattern of cells. He begins with a single cell made by balancing four cards against each other to form a box. He then repeats the cell over and over again and expands outward to form the lattice, forming a good basis for a strong map structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses multiple cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells the kids when he talks in the classrooms, is to place your cards as close together as possible when you lay out your grid, and make sure the cards do not lean at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays maps across the top to make the floor for the next \"story\" in the building. He can add towers, columns, towers or domes. Using the principle of cell repetition, Bryan builds structures with amazing strength. In the maps Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big, old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \"We were in the middle of nowhere,\" Bryan recalls, \"with plenty of room to do what we wanted. I always did something by using things like sticks or hay bales.\" Bryan's grandfather taught him to stack cards. Bryan's two interests - building and card stacking - were soon combined. But stacking in his family's farmhouse was challenging. \u201cOur old house had hardwood floors that were not quite level,\u201d he reports. \"And they were not very firm. When people walked around, it was like 'earthquake action.' It was a challenge to build something that would not fall down right away.\" Bryan built tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before building something taller than himself. As he laid a few sets of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how powerful it was. Bryan's towers began to grow taller. How high is too high? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992 when he was in high school. When he learned that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slender tower that topped at 14 feet 6 inches. Performed as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 playing cards. Since then, he has won world records for even taller buildings. His latest winner measured 25 feet 3.5 inches and used about 2,400 playing cards. Why do these towers not fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a repeated pattern of stories and a tapered top. Bryan likes to point out how map buildings look real. They are built cell by cell, history by history. The separate parts form one strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight may not all be top notch. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits that it's sometimes painful to watch his structures be destroyed.

Depression is a state of mind that most of us experience at some point. There are some periods in our lives where everything seems difficult. It seems like everything is getting worse and we have no control over our lives. Studies have shown that music can be an important mood lifter in such situations. Music also plays a big role in making us feel less nervous or worried. Anxiety can often cause sleep loss and other illnesses. Music is often known as an international language. We may not know the language another person speaks, but most of us respond to music in the same way. Music can often be the best way to get in touch with someone. Music is one of the best ways to improve your mood, but it can very much depend on what kind of music you are listening to. While happy music can definitely make you feel better, sad music can lower your mood further. Listening to classical music can often make you feel much more powerful soft music can be the perfect way to relax at the end of a long road. If you want to use music to change the way you feel, understand the role it plays, learn to recognize the kind of music that lifts your mood and helps you feel better.

The finding should remove the fear that such laws could have the opposite effect because they could make people smoke more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places over the past few years. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of U.S. states have comprehensive bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer nations. Opponents often argue that bans can result in people smoking more at home, which would be worse for their children's health. Asthma is one of the biggest concerns, as passive smoking damages children's airways in several ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Center reviewed as many as 11 studies examining how hospitalizations for pediatric asthma and premature births changed after the smoking ban came into effect. The studies involved more than 2.5 million births and nearly 250,000 hospitalizations for asthma. The results show that both asthma admissions and premature birth rates fell by about 10 percent within a year after smoking restrictions were implemented. The effect on premature births could also be caused by pregnant women being more likely to quit or cut back after a public ban, Been says. But Been also says the studies could not quite prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. But in fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, and most experienced health improvements. Such results are useful for countries and states where there is an ongoing debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially since hospital treatment of premature babies is so expensive. This can be one of the most important things to know to strengthen the law.

The law to be passed this month is likely to cause a revolution in family affairs in a country where 40 % of men reportedly do not do housework at all. It will oblige men to \"share domestic responsibilities and care and attention\" for children and elderly family members, according to the draft approved by the Spanish Parliament's Justice Commission. \"This will be a great way to remind people what their duties are. It's something feminists have wanted for a long time,\" said Margarita Uria, of the Basque Nationalist Party, which was behind an amendment to a new divorce law. . . Failure to comply with the obligations will be taken into account by the judges when determining the terms of the divorce. Men who refuse to do their part may have less frequent contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times more time on housework than men. Even when both have jobs outside the home, Spanish women still do three times as much work in the house. \"It's not just about housework, though,\" Ms Uria said. A study five years ago by the Spanish Center for Sociological Research concluded that fathers spent an average of 13 minutes each day caring for their children. Only 19% of Spanish men thought it was right for mothers of school-age children to have a full-time job. More than a third believed that mothers should not work outside the home at all. The amendment to the Spanish legal code will see domestic obligations added to a list of marital obligations that currently include fidelity, cohabitation and helping each other.

This is the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees in how to handle an active shooting situation in the workplace. The app works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset released earlier this year. An active shooting situation is when one or more armed persons actively shoot in a small, populated area with the intent to kill. There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year saw the deadliest active shooting situation in American history, with 49 people killed at a nightclub in Orlando. In the training situation, users have four choices. They can lock themselves inside the office. They can hide, perhaps in the office closet. They can run after an exit. Or they can use something in the office - a computer or a cup of scissors - as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement on standard training for active shooters. Gallo says that typically teaches people to lock themselves in place and hide. The \"lock down\" method is common ineffective , he says, and has resulted in many deaths in recent years. In the basic level of training, no one is killed. But as training becomes more advanced, players who make the wrong choice get shot. There is no blood; the screen simply slowly turns black. If this sounds scary, it's meant to be. There are plenty of training programs to teach employees how to deal with violence in the workplace, sometimes involving role-playing games with toy weapons.

Studies have shown that people who ate foods rich in antioxidants have a low risk of heart disease. In addition to anti-aging and healthy heart benefits, the dark chocolate can also lower blood pressure and reduce bad cholesterol to as high as 10%. Lowering blood pressure in patients with high blood levels is good because it will reduce the risk of stroke and certain health crises. Low levels of cholesterol in the blood are also good for the heart and eliminate the risk of blood vessels that can harden too much cholesterol in them.

Although not everyone said they were generally happier, most claimed that their marriages had improved since their children had moved away from home. Researchers believe this is not only because the spouses spent more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company. things are a little more relaxed. \"Psychologist Sara Gorchoff, who conducted the study, said:\" The take-home message for couples with young children is 'hang in there'. \"Her co-author Oliver John added:\" Do not wait until your children leave the home of planning quality. time with your partner. \"However, Dr. Dorothy Rowe, of the British Psychological Society, said the effects of living in an 'empty nest' will depend on the parents' relationship with their children.\" If you're just waiting for them to leave home so you can move on with your life, then of course you'll be happy to see them go, \"she said,\" but if you've built your life around your children, you will be terribly lonely.

Most hybrid cars on the roads right now are petrol-electric hybrids. The petrol-electric hybrid car is just what it sounds like - a cross between a petrol-powered car and an electric car. A gas-powered car has a fuel tank that supplies gasoline to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that supply power to the car. To be useful to you or me, a car should be able to drive at least 483 km before refueling, be able to be refueled quickly and easily and fast enough to keep up with the rest of the traffic on the road. A petrol car meets these requirements but produces a large amount of pollution. However, an electric car produces almost no pollution, but can only drive 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) between recharging. And the problem has been that the electric car is very slow and inconvenient to recharge. A petrol electric car combines the benefits of the two power sources into one system that uses both gas power and electric power.

My wife and I wanted to give James the best education, but that meant we had to change our jobs and spend less time with our child. I asked myself, \"Would this trade-off be worth it?\" When I look at research into children's development, I think it might not be. Where our children go to school may be less important than most American parents think. Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children grow up to be successful. In a 2001 study, Greg Duncan , a professor of education at the University of California, measured the impact that people in a child's life have on how well a child performs in school. Duncan and his team found almost no correlation between how the students performed on the test and who they sat on. next to the class that they hung out with after school and that lived in their block. The only meaningful connection they found was between siblings and twins in particular. For a long time, researchers believed that a family's income greatly influenced how well children fared in life. But that may not have been the case. When Susan Mayer at the University of Chicago looked at the relationship between family income and life outcomes, she conducted a series of experiments to measure that finding such outcomes was not caused by income. She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a child has, or how often his family goes to museums. Lareau, another scholar, began one of the most in-depth observations of American parenting. He concluded that success is much more related to the amount of time parents spend with their children. He said: \"Many parents I have interviewed are worried about their children's future. But they have exaggerated the sense of the risks involved if they do not give their children 'the best' of everything.\" So finally we decided to leave things as they are.

At the end of the year, the study leaders compared the students' performance with the assessments. Despite their real abilities, there was an astonishingly high correlation between performance and ratings. It seems that people are performing as well as we expect them to. That Self-fulfilling Effect is also known as the Pygmalion effect. This is from an ancient Greek history. The story was also the basis of George Bernard Shaw's play \"Pygmalion\", later transformed into the musical \"My Fair Lady\". In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims he can turn a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a Duchess. But as Eliza herself points out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it is not what she learns or does that determines whether she will become a Duchess, but how she will be treated. The implication of the Pygmalion effect for leaders and leaders is massive. This means that your team's performance depends less on them than it does on you. The performance you get from people is neither more nor less than what you expect, which means you should always expect the best. As Goethe said, \"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is.

Because we can not see what we can not see, our lecturer was determined to catch us on fresh deed. He made us watch a video of six people throwing basketball back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was only to keep track of the throws among people in white. The tape rolled and everyone started counting. Everyone except me. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw that bond with the confusing basketball pitchers, I knew I would not be able to keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. However, I became curious when about 30 seconds inside the tape, a gorilla came in among the players. She (we later found out that a female student was in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, slapped her chest with her fist, and then walked away while continuing to give the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball throws. The hands went up all over it. He then asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who had scored the perfect 15 . Then he asked, \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to find that I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the great room who did. He had set us up and caught us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but it was not him who had played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is the basic organizing principle of the brain, and I believe it gives us a great opportunity. My position is different from that of many neuroscientists: where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for collaboration. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control our various forms of attention and take advantage of them.

Queensland Rail Chief Executive Officer Paul Scurrah said rising waterways had closed some train lines, and road closures and property damage throughout the South East had contributed to a shortage of available rail workers. \"We intend to run trains every hour on all routes, similar to the timetable we run on Christmas Day 2. We will also seek to run other additional services to meet the demand as needed. At this time, we will run services, stopping at all stations that will depart at the same time per hour, however, everything depends on the weather conditions and the availability of train staff. \" Scurrah encouraged all customers to visit the Translink website to get specific departure times for their station and asked for patience in case of delays. \"Queensland Rail appreciates that reduced services can cause disruption, but it is simply inevitable.

If so, it may end up sounding like a famous pen manufacturer - BIC. An argument is made that Goldman Sachs' famous marketing unit, the BRICs, really should be the BICs. \"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins for \"The Russian Balance Sheet\", believes that Putin's and Medvedev's Russia just is not worthy of being included with Brazil, India and China on the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one has to ask whether it has any impact on the global economy at all compared to the other members of its group. I have just returned home from Moscow, which is always \"Boring around this season. In the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has lived off oil and gas.\" Financially, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund states that the Russian economy will decline by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less case for Brazil with a drop of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing tool to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it can be argued that Russia leads the BRICs. Its stock market has risen 128 percent this year, while about 80 percent is for the other three.

Here, the experts identify the problems that teenagers' choice of shoes entails. KEDS / VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are especially popular among teenage boys - with Keds and Vans the most coveted brands. The main problem is that they are just too flat - so flat that the heel that hits the ground first also gets damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are such light and thin doll shoes. The problem is partly their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. But ballet pumps that have no string or heel have other specific problems. \"Since the shoe has no fastening device, it depends on the toes to hold the shoe on, causing an awkward gait, this leads to short- and long-term problems such as hard skin, heel and knee pain.\" Wedges and stilettos These shoes can also cause walking problems. They may look good, but the heels of these are so high that they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teenagers who wear these shoes regularly are also at risk of joining the millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES What do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday use? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a drawstring to hold it on, with a small heel and a deep toe box that does not press on the toes, such as Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino.

The Internet is one of these approaches. Learning through the internet is a new style that seems to be more successful than traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a large amount of learning materials that are available to students online. Due to the choices of courses online, it becomes much easier to complete a program. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spent hours searching for the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience as a first time mom, I find it very helpful to use information online. While I am at home with my baby, I can still search for the material I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my house. The Internet is not only a great information provider, but also a money and time saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future due to internet access to information. The cost of land, buildings and salaries for teachers is constantly rising. In addition, regular courses (offline) are heavily dependent on books and other paper-based materials, while online education sends lectures and assignments electronically, saving thousands of dollars each year. Without physical restrictions, internet classes and courses are also very practical. In classroom-based tuition, there is a limit to the number of students, while internet tuition is available to everyone. Students do not have to struggle to sign up for the classes they like.
