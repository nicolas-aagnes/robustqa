When they get out of the cab, they tip the driver generously and bribe him not to say anything about them to anyone. Alice and Judson check the departure sign for the Silver Queen, on their way to Panama City, Panama, and seem tense and anxious. While waiting for the same flight, Peggy Nolan is also waiting, to whom a delivery of expensive flowers is made with a card thanking her for some service. Peggy contemptuously throws the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman who sells cheap gardenia. Shortly after, the flight gets ready to go and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs Spengler is a dominant woman, but her husband seems happy to be around as a child. While waiting for the asphalt near the plane, a car drives up and a well-dressed man shows up with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is sent away with \"uncle\" Pete until his father - a gangster - can follow later. When the passengers board, Bill, the pilot, is told that they will transport an anarchist back to Panama, but he assures the group that there is nothing to worry about because the man will be in custody during the flight.\nThe prisoner is Vasquez and is accompanied by a bounty hunter named Crimp. After steward Larry helps everyone to recover, the flight departs with its twelve souls on board. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the break and Joe indicates that he has an interest in Alice. He goes back to the compartment where the beds are made and people turn in for the night - except for Crimp who plans to stay up and make sure Vasquez does not \"go for a walk\" - and thus deceives the executioner and himself for $ 5,000. Pete stops in his young charge for the night and helps him pray his prayers (something Pete is not familiar with). Peggy comes up to the cockpit to greet Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he does not want anything to do with her. When Alice calls for the steward, Joe takes the call and makes a play for her. The next morning, the plane arrives for a stop for refueling in Mexico and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to pursue Alice, assuming she's Judson's secretary. Peggy takes another bite to get Bill to warm up and is rejected again. Then Pete tells her that her help is not needed when she tries to get Tommy to drink his milk. Peggy has been \"marked\" as a loose woman by her fellow travelers who do not want anything to do with her. Before a reporter boardes the plane, a reporter confronts Judson and Alice and Joe find out she's engaged to her \"boss\" and they escape. the flight continues and heads out in stormy weather. The professor discusses the methods for a South American tribe of headhunters to practice their craft. The conversation is interrupted by a news bulletin that tells how Tommy's father has been killed.
